DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT1;Tampering;lampering is essentially an attack on contidentiality and availability. Data tampering occurs when an attacker modifies, adds, or deletes data in the end device itself. In such attacks, the end device is compromised by physically capturing a node from the network. The attacker can collect all infomation and try to recover beneficial infomation. An advanced attacker can recover, reprogram and redeploy it in the field to attack the network. An attacker can study the type and fomat of data that is being transmitted by Iol devices, and attempt to tamper and generate the same. In such a case, the accuracy of the data generated by the network is questionable. An autonomic scheme for self- protection based on device identities, and proper authentication, is needed to preserve the integrity of data. The MAPE architecture can be implemented as follows. The system can monitor for suspicious data being generated by the nodes, and periodic checks could be made to see whether the node has been compromised. Based on this control data, the system can mitigate it by dropping the data generated by the suspicious node. For example, if the system detects possible capture, it may remotely instruct the node to delete any data stored on the device, such as security keys and synchronization data. This can significantly delay and prevent attempts at reverse-engineering. In the scheme by [p24] the primary concept is that neither the keys nor any usable data are stored on a RFID tag, and thus capture of a node will results in little or no damage to the syst em. Tampering is classified as a low threat category, but highly affects the integrity of data.;P15;SPTK17  SPTK30  SPTK31  DTK4  DTK11  (Others countemeasures: P15 p9 p24)
DVC  TAG  SSR  ATT;PLTT2;Jamming;Jamming simply means to exploit the transmission of a radio signal to interfere with the radio frequencies being used by the sensor network. Jamming can be perfomed either continuously or in an intemittent way, in both the cases, network will suffer from considerable damage. Jamming attack is usually camied out during the operational phase. Jamming takes place at link-level by sending forged packets to create collisions, thereby, dropping legitimate packets. Jamming is an attack on availability and renders the wireless spectrum to be unusable for the constituent devices. The threat level from jamming based attacks can be considered very high in IoT due to the characteristic of remote, unmonitored deployment of Iol devices. Jamming mitigation approaches fall traditionally under self-healing paradigm. Jamming is classified as a physical layer attack in which the radio frequencies are disturbed by use of interference and saturated with noise signals which effect the transmission of legitimate signals. Signal jamming of radio frequency channels results in a DoS attack and is prevented by a proper monitoring of cognitive spectrum,and eventually distributing the usage across the available spectrum. In the popular techniques of jamming mitigation, autonomic behavior is manifest and can be further developed as follows. Wireless sensors such as sniffers usually collect details about Received Signal Strength ndicator (RSSI) values and similar wireless infomation from the environment. This represents the "Monitor" phase of the MAPE architecture. These details are compared with known pattems and extreme values for specific paramet ers, such as an abnomally high RSSI values in a specitic frequency of the spectrum. Once a possible jamming attack is suspected, the appropriate mitigation method is planned, and then executed by the effector. In the technique by [p20], instead of monitoring the RSSI values, analysis of the hearing range of the wireless nodes inside the jammer area is done. The execution of mitigation can follow different foms as well. Some methods attempt to neutralize the jammer signals by cancellation [p21] and by switching the usage in other portions of the spectrum [p22], whereas some merely attempt to localize the jammer for further action [p23]. Some methods are also specifically designed to cater for problem s in specific access control methods. As an example, DEEJAM [pl19] attempts to mitigate jamming attacks specifically in IEEE S02.15.4 standard based wireless networks.;P15;SPTK1 SHTK5 SPTK33 SPTK34 SPTK35 SPTK36 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countemeasures P9p20, p21.p22, p23,p15);
DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT3;Deactivation;This refers to the physical destruction of the node or unauthorized application of a kill" command. Deactivation results in loss of availability in the network We can imagine the following scenario to appreciate the need of mitigation methods against deactivation. Smart cities are filled with IoT devices, to sense and actuate, and are in the danger of being destroyed or stolen by people. This can redefine modem day cyber vandalism to a new level. An attacker can also attempt to enter the intertace of the node. and trv to shutdown. or kill the devicekrom network's perspective. both these attacks will lead the node to stop being detected, and cease to function. Password protection as well as physical security measures such as camouflage can provide some respite. However, a large scale application of this attack will result in the network falling apart and perhaps DoS may result in multi- hop environments. Deactivation can be classitied as a high impact attack in the wisdom that perhaps there are no software methods that can effectively prevent it. Remote triggering of the kill command can be disabled, but a physical damage cannot be. The only way out is to protect the node from extemal infuences by enclosing in a protective case. Monitoring the status of IoT devices is important, which also includes monitoring the physical condition of the nodes. It may be argued that autonomic computing does not exactly fit as a possible solution for this attack, as the scope is more physical and is not affected by soft ware mechanisms. However, monitoring the status and analysis of such data could help the user reduce the downtime of the system. The MAPE architecture could monitor the loss of any node, and then assign its offered services to some other node in the network, such that overall service levels are maintained. That would be one manner, where self-healing could be demonstrated for deactivation.;P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Other countemeasures: P15.p9)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT4;Collision;Collision is similar to the jamming attack, as the loss of data packets happens by virtue of simultaneous existence of signals in the concemed spectrum. Collision may also occur intrinsically in a large network due to problems in the design of synchronization and transmission times. Transmitted data packets can be disrupted by the malicious users transmitting asynchronously that can result in a checksum mismatch or back-off in some MAC protocols. An attacker listens on the communication medium and guesses the expected time of message transmission. The attacker then sends a message at the same time when a proper message is started which results in collision of the message in the wireless medium. Repeated cycles of collision can result in a DoS attack and affect the availability. In IoT, there is a high probability of collision due to co-existence of many protocols in the WIFI 2.4 GHz band [p25]. Monitoring RSSI values such as in jamming mitigation is not of much use, as attacker's signals are more dynamic and stealthier. An autonomic system can recover by dynamically adapting with a variable flow control mechanism for collision mitigation due to a jammer. Autonomic self-healing for collision recovery by random number based mechanisms [p261];P15;SPTK17 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countemeasures: P15.p9. p26)
DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT5;Exhaustion;Exhaustion results as an after-effect of some attacks. Devices on batteries can be energv exhausted if the network faces continuous collisions and DoS attacks. In many M2M MAC layer protocols, collision results in repeated attempts at re-transmission, which highly drains the battery resources. Solutions of rate limitation and a timer can help prevent exhaustion in end nodes. Exhaustion could be a result of other attacks, which aim to exhaust the energy resources. Exhaustion is classified under DoS for high impact attacks and has been linked to the deactivation attacks. The linkage is due to the common pattem of the pemanent removal of nodes from the network with a common goal to reduce the network size. Common mitigation methods include rate limitation, use of timers, cognitive adaptation, as well as cross layer designing [p27]. Autonomic decisions may inchude deciding on duty cycling methods and cognitive adaptation. The system will not only protect the availability but also help in prolonging the lifetime of the network.;P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countemeasures P15.p9, P27)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT6;De-synchronization and replay;Request tor retransmission of missed frames can be made by repeatedly forcing messages into the network which cary sequence numbers to one or both end points. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based schemes are particularly vulnerable and few countemeasures are explained by [p28]. In this scenario, separate methods exist for single hop networks and multi-hop networks. Replay is mostly an attack on synchronization whereby an attacker stores previously transmitted data and repeats it at a later time to mislead the receiver node. Many authentication mechanisms are immune against the replay attack, and lessons can be leamt in order to design an autonomic secure system. Smple encryption of data can also be an etfective means against the replay attack. Replay attack could thus be considered as the easiest attack to be mitigated. It has been placed in a high risk category as failure of mitigation can lead to the downfall of the efficiency in the network. The [p30] mitigates the replay attack by dynamically changing the session key upon fulfillment of certain conditions.;P15;SPTK17 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTKI1 SPTK22 (Others countermeasures P28, p29.p30)

Moreover the communication between RFID tag and RFID reader is done through a unique Electronic Product Code (EPC), which may be sabotaged by the attacker if they collect the EPC.

DVC TAG SSR ATT;HTT1;Energy Limitations;A typical IoT healthcare network incudes small health devices of limited battery power (eg., body temperature and BP sensors).

DVC TAG SSR ATT;HTT5;Computational Limitations;IoT health devices are embedded with low-speed processors. The central processing unit (CPU) m such devices is not very powerfül in tems of its speed. In addition, these devices are not designed to perfom computationally expensive operations. That is, they simply act as a sensor or actuator. Therefore, finding a security solution that minimizes resource consumption and thus maximizes security perfomance is a challenging task.;P66;AAK
DVC TAG SSR ATT;HTT6;Mobility;In general, healthcare devices are not static but mobile in nature. Such devices are connected to the Intemet through IoT service providers. For example, a wearable body temperature sensor or a heart monitor may be connected to the Intemet and notifies the concemed caregiver of the user's conditions. Such wearable are connected to the home network when the user is at home, whereas they are connected to the office network when he or she is at office. Different networks have different security configurations and settings. Therefore, developing a mobility-compliant security algorithm is a serious challenge.;P66;AAK

RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT1;Hello Flood;Some routing protocols require nþdes to broadcast hello messages to announce themselves to their neighbors.. A node which receives such a message may assume that it is within a radio range of the sender and attempt to use the route as a communication path. However an attacker with large enough transmission power could convince every other node in the network that the attacker is its neighbor. This will lead to far away nodes sending the packets to the attacker which will be lost. The work by Singh [p31] presents some countemeasures. This is a fundamental issue when it comes to acknowledgment based systems. However, acknowledgments are usually in the dominion of a powerful host with sufficient energy resources. For routing mechanisms, unequal transmission radio of legitimate nodes may also result in a hello flood. This attack has been classified as a low impact attack on availability. Autonomic mitigation mechanism may include use of authentication, and puzzle schemes such as des cribed by [p32];P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others counteme asures: P31, p32. pl5, p9)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT2;Sink Hole;An adversary attracts a central node and compromises it leading to loss in availability. This leads to message drops and even a DoS attack. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is described by [p33] particularly to detect the sinkhole attack for the Mint Route protocol. Furthemore, the IDs by [p34] is able to detect the sinkhole attack for network s using link quality indication (LQI) based routing protocol. An autonomic system, however, demands reactive measures to be taken once the detection has occured. The risk level in this case is very high as compared to the tampering attack where just a handful of end nodes are compromised. Not only can all the data be sniffed, but the network could be controlled if it is infrastructure based. Autonomic methods may include the use of distributed architecture and use of authentication [p35];P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 DTK7 DTK8 DTK12 (Others counteme asures p34, p35)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT3;Sybil Attack;In a Sybil attack, a single node creates its own multiple identities and presents it to other nodes in the network using them to gain a disproportionately large influence. This will result in removal of all original neighbors from the table of active sensor nodes in the routing table. System's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how easily identities can be generated. It also depends on the degree of reputation to which the system accepts inputs from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity. The local Sybil resistance scheme (LSR) attempts to detect Sybil attacks particularly in the use case of vehicular networks [p36]. Vehicular networks seem to be the hot topic as a use-case for research in Sybil attacks. [p36] also discussed the availability of a road side unit (RSU) to help counter and detect the attack. Work by [p37] also focuses on vehicular networks and aims to detect the Sybil attack through a distributed, work load and passive overhearing. They attempt to preserve privacy while doing the same, and claim minimal overhead and network delay. The work by [p39] discusses three requirements for defenses against a Sybil attack in a vehicular network. First, any proposed scheme should protect the infomation about the nodes, and thereby preserve privacy. Second, the response time of the counter measure should be immediate. Finally, a verifier should be employed to prevent the Sybil attack to automatically adapt towards the prevention schemes. Lessons from autonomic computing can contribute highly to the third requirement. They propose Sybil Guard which portrays the use of these requirements and sets a limit to the number of false identities that can be initiated by a malicious user. Sybil Limit is proposed by [p38] from the same research group which improves upon the concepts set by earlier by adopting and including a social based setup. Mobility is considered by [p36] and by [p37] specifically in the case of vehicular networks in the form of moving cars etc. The work by [p40]. however, presents a light weight scheme, residing in the lower layers, with support for mobility and variable transmit powers as well. The detection is based on rules such as the ule for values of RSSI for new nodes that attempt to join. This mechanism, however, might not apply in all cases as the analysis is solely on the first RSSI values, which a knowledgeable, powerful malicious node might easily by pass.;P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 SPTK23 DTK10 (Others countemme asures P36, p37 p38p 39.p40)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT4;Selective Forwarding/Gray Hole;Certain malicious nodes can refuse to forward some messages and just drop them. This can result in delay and bandwidth degradation in the whole network. Thus, confidentiality and availability are compromised. Probing and redundancy checks can be the possible solution. Many soutions have been proposed which range from providing detection to a complete recovery. Others focus on lessening the damage caused. A scheme which detects and recovers the network has been proposed by [p41]. With a claimed accuracy of over 95%, the scheme employs a messaging based watemark technique to keep track of the forwarded path. This scheme however, claims to result in network delay due to the cost of processing. The work by [p42] focuses on the Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and similar routing protocols before proposing a scheme that consists of two phases of detection and localization. They use packet counters to keep track of a series of control messages which are passed through the wvireless nodes. Another method temed CADE, also makes use of acknowledgement based detection but eliminates time synchronization requirements [p43].| CADE makes use of cumulative techniques and claims to reduce overhead. Another technique by [p44] breaks the information packets into a multitude of smaller pieces, propagated along specific paths and then the decision of malicious node presence is made. A complete survey on the proposed solution for this attack has been conducted by [p45]. The common mitigation measures which can benefit from autonomic practices incude probing, redundancy, and message based detection [p46].;P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 DTK12 DTK13 DTK14 DTK15 (Others counteme asures P41.p42.p 43.p44.p4 5.p46)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT5;Eavesdropping and Traffic Analysis;The eavesdropping attack and traftic analysis act as a pre -requisite to many other attacks, and usually the transmitter and the receiver are unaware of the presence of this attack. Eavesdropping and traftic analysis are classitied as either passive or active. In passive eavesdropping. the attacker detects communication traftīc by listening to the transmission medium, and processes it to extract vital infomation. On the other hand, in active eavesdropping. the attacker sends control data as queies to initiate specitic processes and replies from the destination device. The reply is further used in the analysis to pave the way for other attacks. It is hard to decide on whether eavesdropping should be grouped under M2M, Network or Cloud attack since data can be eavesdropped at levels of communication. Eavesdropping on data in the M2M layer is easy, but not as beneficial as the adversary can only eavesdrop on selected portions of the system, and the raw data may not be particularly useful. Wireless IoT devices are heavily prone to eavesdropping. On the other hand, eavesdropping on data in the Cloud layer is essentially the most profitable, as context infomation is included as well. However, the ease of implementing an eavesdropping attack on the Network layer makes it suitable for this category. Eavesdropping could be active or passive, depending upon whether the sniffed data is just monitored for information, or used for initiating another attack. The MITM attack is an example of an active eavesdropDing attack. Here. the adversary makes independent connections with the source and destination devices, acting as a router, and transfers messages between them. In this process, data is captured, understood and modified. Eaves dropping on a new device that is attempting to join a network may allow the attacker to observe control data. This can further allow the attacker to generate messages impersonating other devices, and to manipulate and understand how the network topology is built.;P15,P16;SPTK3 SPTK4 SPTK5 SPTK32 SPTK33 SPTK34 SPTK35 SPTK36 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others counterme asures P47.p48)

The adversary will then be able to decrypt/encrypt any data coming from A and B with the keys that he shares with both of them. Both A and B will think that they are talking with each other.;P60;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT18;ACK Attack;An ACK attack is a TCP based attack. TCP (Iransmission Control Protocol) is a highly reliable host-to-host protocol. TCP uses sequence numbers and acknowledgements of packets, which allows for retransmission upon loss of packets. When two processes want to communicate, a so called three-way handshake initializes the connection between them. A SYN packet is sent first, which is answered by a SYN-ACK. The SYN-ACK packet is an acknowledgement of the SYN packet. The SYN-ACK gets answered by an ACK, which concludes the initialization. For an ACK attack, a TCP connection needs to be established between the attacker and the target device. The attacker sends packets with the ACK-bit enabled and a forged source address. This forged source address is also called a spoofed IP address. The target device will then drop these packets, as the device does not have established connections with the host of the spoofed IP address. The drop of these packets causes resource exhaustion as each packets has to be processed, resulting in a denial of service. [p18];P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT19;CHARGE N Attack;The Character Generator Protocol (CharGen) was created as an useful debugging and measurem ent tool. It is either used as a TCP based or an UDP based character generator service. UDP based CharGen attacks are used more than TCP based CharGen attacks, as TCP needs to have a connection established while UDP does not. The attacker sends a packet from a spoofed IP address to a device that has CharGen enabled, and the response will be sent to the target device. This response can have a maximum size of 512 bytes according to the specifications. The standard port CharGen uses is port 19 [p18];P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT20;DNS Attack;The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to provide a mechanism where resources are named in such a way that names can be used instead of having to remember IP addresses. DNS makes use of DNS resolvers to retrieve the infomation associated with a domain name. The standard port DNS uses is port 53. In a DNS amplification attack, attackers use open DNS resolvers. They send DNS lookup requests with a spoofed source address to these resolvers. The DNS resolver responds to these packets by sendng a DNSrecord response, which is sent to the target device instead of the device of the attacker. Such a response is generally much larger than the query, which contains only the domain. A response can include many different records of infomation for a domain.

RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT21;ICMP Attack;The Intemet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol used for sending eror messages, for example when a gateway does not have the buffering capacity to forward a packet or when a packet cannot reach its destination. A function that usually is implemented in ICMP is the ping function. Ping is used to detemine if a path exists between two hosts. This is mostly used to check if another host is up. ICMP allows for ECHO request and ECHO reply messages to be sent. When pinging an other host, an ECHO request is sent, which is answered with an ECHO reply by the other host. If an ECHO reply is not received, the other host is probably down or does not support the ping functionality. An ICMP flood overwhelms the target device with ICMP Echo Request packets which are sent very fast without waiting for a reply from the target device. The target device often tries to answer these packets with ICMP Echo Reply packets, resulting in a consumption of both outgoing and incoming bandwidth [p18];P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT22;NTP Attack;The Network' lime Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize clockS on the Intemet. NIP uses mechanisms to combine the statistics of multiple NTP servers to detemine the time in UTC. These statistics are requested by sending queries. The standard port NTP uses is port 123. In older versions of NTP, one of these queries is "monlist". This request retums a list of the last 600 hosts that have made a connection to the server. The attacker requests this query with a spoofed source address, resulting in a considerably larger response with the list being sent to the target device. [P18];P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT23;SSDP Attack;The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) allows processes to send messages to each other with a minimum of protocol mechanics. Itis not a reliable protocol, the protocol is transaction oriented and does not guarantee delivery, duplicate protection or ordering. The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) makes use of UDP as its underlying protocol. SSDP is a protocol often used in Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) devices. It provides a mechanism which can be used to discover devices, making use of multicast to send a HTTP UDP discovery request. When a device receives such a discovery request, it responds with an unicast UDP response. The standard port SSDP uses is port 1900. In an attack abusing SSDP, the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is used to deliver specifically created packets to UPnP devices, which elicits an response with amplified packets that can be reflected to the target.;P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT24;SYN Attack;ASYNHood is a TCP based attack. In this attack, the target device receives SYN packets from the attacker at a high packet rate, trying to initiate the TCP three-way handshake. The target device responds to these packets by sending SYN-ACK packets that needs to be answered with an ACK packet as explained above. The attacker does not answer the target host's SYN-ACK packet either by not responding with the required ACK packet, or by having sent the first SYN packet from a spoofed IP address. The target device will wait for the ACK packets to amive, allocating resources to these half-open connections, until no new connections can be made.;P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT25;UDP Floods Attack;In this attack, the attacker sends a large number of UDP packets to random ports at the target device. The device will respond by checking the application listening at that port. Upon finding no application listening at those ports, the target device responds with an ICMP Destination Unreachable packet. This process of receiving, checking and answering results in the target device being overwhelmed and unreachable.;P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT26;UDP Fragment Attack;This attack uses IP ragmentation to attack the target. IP tragmentation is a process where iP packets are broken down, sent across the network and reassembled at the receiver. In an UDP fragment attack, the attacker sends forged packets that have a big enough size to be fragmented and reassembled. As these packets are fake, the target device cannot reassemble them. This force the target device to allocate resources to try to reassemble these packets until the device is overloaded. Akamai states that some of the recorded fragmented UDP packets were the direct result of an amplification by other forms of DDoS attacks;P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT27;TCP Anomaly Attack;TCP makes use of Flags in its packets to indicate how the packet should be handled. The TCP anomaly attack counts are TCP floods that Akamai classified as using uncommon or anomalous TCP Flags. These are usually the result froma combination of coding emors and modifications aimed to use TCP packets in attacks. In most of the cases, the attacker makes use of a SYN Flood where the flags have been modified in such a way that the SYN flag is not the only flag set.;P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT28;RIP Attack;Kouting ntomation Protocol version I RIP) 1s a protocol to dynamically share route infomation on a small network quickly and easily. This protocol makes use of pot 520. RIP was introduced in 1988 and its Request For Comments (RFC) is now listed as a historic document, which means this protocol is deprecated. Using a list of known RIPvl routers on the intemet, attackers can craft a request query that is broadcasted as nomal. The attacker makes use ofa spoofed IP address, resulting in the response being sent to the target.;P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT ODRSC;NLTT29;RESET Attack;This attack is a TCP attack. As mentioned before, TCP makes use of flags to indicate how a packet should be handled. One of the flags is the "RST Flag. Setting this flag indicates that the connection must be teminated. In a RESET attack, the attacker takes over the connection between to hosts. The attacker then sends packets with the RST Flag set to one, or both, of the hosts. This teminates the connection between the two hosts, which is a denial of service.;P18;SPTK32 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11
