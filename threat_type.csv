DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT1;Tampering;lampering is essentially an attack on contidentiality and availability. Data tampering occurs when an attacker modifies, adds, or deletes data in the end device itself. In such attacks, the end device is compromised by physically capturing a node from the network. The attacker can collect all infomation and try to recover beneficial infomation. An advanced attacker can recover, reprogram and redeploy it in the field to attack the network. An attacker can study the type and fomat of data that is being transmitted by Iol devices, and attempt to tamper and generate the same. In such a case, the accuracy of the data generated by the network is questionable. An autonomic scheme for self- protection based on device identities, and proper authentication, is needed to preserve the integrity of data. The MAPE architecture can be implemented as follows. The system can monitor for suspicious data being generated by the nodes, and periodic checks could be made to see whether the node has been compromised. Based on this control data, the system can mitigate it by dropping the data generated by the suspicious node. For example, if the system detects possible capture, it may remotely instruct the node to delete any data stored on the device, such as security keys and synchronization data. This can significantly delay and prevent attempts at reverse-engineering. In the scheme by [p24] the primary concept is that neither the keys nor any usable data are stored on a RFID tag, and thus capture of a node will results in little or no damage to the syst em. Tampering is classified as a low threat category, but highly affects the integrity of data.;P15;SPTK17  SPTK30  SPTK31  DTK4  DTK11  (Others countemeasures: P15 p9 p24)
DVC  TAG  SSR  ATT;PLTT2;Jamming;Jamming simply means to exploit the transmission of a radio signal to interfere with the radio frequencies being used by the sensor network. Jamming can be perfomed either continuously or in an intemittent way, in both the cases, network will suffer from considerable damage. Jamming attack is usually camied out during the operational phase. Jamming takes place at link-level by sending forged packets to create collisions, thereby, dropping legitimate packets. Jamming is an attack on availability and renders the wireless spectrum to be unusable for the constituent devices. The threat level from jamming based attacks can be considered very high in IoT due to the characteristic of remote, unmonitored deployment of Iol devices. Jamming mitigation approaches fall traditionally under self-healing paradigm. Jamming is classified as a physical layer attack in which the radio frequencies are disturbed by use of interference and saturated with noise signals which effect the transmission of legitimate signals. Signal jamming of radio frequency channels results in a DoS attack and is prevented by a proper monitoring of cognitive spectrum,and eventually distributing the usage across the available spectrum. In the popular techniques of jamming mitigation, autonomic behavior is manifest and can be further developed as follows. Wireless sensors such as sniffers usually collect details about Received Signal Strength ndicator (RSSI) values and similar wireless infomation from the environment. This represents the "Monitor" phase of the MAPE architecture. These details are compared with known pattems and extreme values for specific paramet ers, such as an abnomally high RSSI values in a specitic frequency of the spectrum. Once a possible jamming attack is suspected, the appropriate mitigation method is planned, and then executed by the effector. In the technique by [p20], instead of monitoring the RSSI values, analysis of the hearing range of the wireless nodes inside the jammer area is done. The execution of mitigation can follow different foms as well. Some methods attempt to neutralize the jammer signals by cancellation [p21] and by switching the usage in other portions of the spectrum [p22], whereas some merely attempt to localize the jammer for further action [p23]. Some methods are also specifically designed to cater for problem s in specific access control methods. As an example, DEEJAM [pl19] attempts to mitigate jamming attacks specifically in IEEE S02.15.4 standard based wireless networks.;P15;SPTK1 SHTK5 SPTK33 SPTK34 SPTK35 SPTK36 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countemeasures P9p20, p21.p22, p23,p15);
DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT3;Deactivation;This refers to the physical destruction of the node or unauthorized application of a kill" command. Deactivation results in loss of availability in the network We can imagine the following scenario to appreciate the need of mitigation methods against deactivation. Smart cities are filled with IoT devices, to sense and actuate, and are in the danger of being destroyed or stolen by people. This can redefine modem day cyber vandalism to a new level. An attacker can also attempt to enter the intertace of the node. and trv to shutdown. or kill the devicekrom network's perspective. both these attacks will lead the node to stop being detected, and cease to function. Password protection as well as physical security measures such as camouflage can provide some respite. However, a large scale application of this attack will result in the network falling apart and perhaps DoS may result in multi- hop environments. Deactivation can be classitied as a high impact attack in the wisdom that perhaps there are no software methods that can effectively prevent it. Remote triggering of the kill command can be disabled, but a physical damage cannot be. The only way out is to protect the node from extemal infuences by enclosing in a protective case. Monitoring the status of IoT devices is important, which also includes monitoring the physical condition of the nodes. It may be argued that autonomic computing does not exactly fit as a possible solution for this attack, as the scope is more physical and is not affected by soft ware mechanisms. However, monitoring the status and analysis of such data could help the user reduce the downtime of the system. The MAPE architecture could monitor the loss of any node, and then assign its offered services to some other node in the network, such that overall service levels are maintained. That would be one manner, where self-healing could be demonstrated for deactivation.;P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Other countemeasures: P15.p9)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT4;Collision;Collision is similar to the jamming attack, as the loss of data packets happens by virtue of simultaneous existence of signals in the concemed spectrum. Collision may also occur intrinsically in a large network due to problems in the design of synchronization and transmission times. Transmitted data packets can be disrupted by the malicious users transmitting asynchronously that can result in a checksum mismatch or back-off in some MAC protocols. An attacker listens on the communication medium and guesses the expected time of message transmission. The attacker then sends a message at the same time when a proper message is started which results in collision of the message in the wireless medium. Repeated cycles of collision can result in a DoS attack and affect the availability. In IoT, there is a high probability of collision due to co-existence of many protocols in the WIFI 2.4 GHz band [p25]. Monitoring RSSI values such as in jamming mitigation is not of much use, as attacker's signals are more dynamic and stealthier. An autonomic system can recover by dynamically adapting with a variable flow control mechanism for collision mitigation due to a jammer. Autonomic self-healing for collision recovery by random number based mechanisms [p261];P15;SPTK17 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countemeasures: P15.p9. p26)
DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT5;Exhaustion;Exhaustion results as an after-effect of some attacks. Devices on batteries can be energv exhausted if the network faces continuous collisions and DoS attacks. In many M2M MAC layer protocols, collision results in repeated attempts at re-transmission, which highly drains the battery resources. Solutions of rate limitation and a timer can help prevent exhaustion in end nodes. Exhaustion could be a result of other attacks, which aim to exhaust the energy resources. Exhaustion is classified under DoS for high impact attacks and has been linked to the deactivation attacks. The linkage is due to the common pattem of the pemanent removal of nodes from the network with a common goal to reduce the network size. Common mitigation methods include rate limitation, use of timers, cognitive adaptation, as well as cross layer designing [p27]. Autonomic decisions may inchude deciding on duty cycling methods and cognitive adaptation. The system will not only protect the availability but also help in prolonging the lifetime of the network.;P15;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countemeasures P15.p9, P27)
RSC DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT6;De-synchronization and replay;Request tor retransmission of missed frames can be made by repeatedly forcing messages into the network which cary sequence numbers to one or both end points. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based schemes are particularly vulnerable and few countemeasures are explained by [p28]. In this scenario, separate methods exist for single hop networks and multi-hop networks. Replay is mostly an attack on synchronization whereby an attacker stores previously transmitted data and repeats it at a later time to mislead the receiver node. Many authentication mechanisms are immune against the replay attack, and lessons can be leamt in order to design an autonomic secure system. Smple encryption of data can also be an etfective means against the replay attack. Replay attack could thus be considered as the easiest attack to be mitigated. It has been placed in a high risk category as failure of mitigation can lead to the downfall of the efficiency in the network. The [p30] mitigates the replay attack by dynamically changing the session key upon fulfillment of certain conditions.;P15;SPTK17 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTKI1 SPTK22 (Others countermeasures P28, p29.p30)
DVC TAG SSR;PLTT7;Signal Interference;A Denial of Service attack can be implemented on any RFID tag by creating and sending noise signals over the Radio Frequency signals which are used by the RFIDs for communication. The noise signals will interfere with the RFID signals hindering communication.;P60;SPTK33 SPTK34 SPTK35 SPTK36 SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countermeasures: p60)
DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT8;Malicious Node Injection;The adversary can physically deploy a new malicious node between two or more nodes of the lol' system, hence controlling all data flow from and to the nodes and their operation; this is also known as Man in The Middle Attack.;P60;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countermeasures: p60)
DVC TAG SSR ATT;PLTT9;Physical Damage;The adversary can physically damage devices of the IoT network for his own gain. This kind of attack is an attack that deals with security of the area or building that hosts the IoT System. It differs from Node Tampering attack as in this situation the adversary tries to directly damage the IoT system with the purpose of impacting the availability of service.;P60;SPTK30 SPTK31 DTK4 DTK11 (Others countemmeasures: p60)
