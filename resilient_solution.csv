EETK1;SNBP;Simple Naive Bayes Prediction model (SNBP model) is a technique to remove unnecessary and redundant data, which saves he energy to be used for transmission of data in Wireless Sensor Networks and increases the life of network as data for  ransmission is reduced which saves that energy of sensor nodes.;P70

EETK5;Energy Efficient Data Aggregation technique;Energy Efficient Data Aggregation technique is a energy efficient routing protocol for WirelesSSensor Networks which is energy efficient and reliable. This technique is based on cluster formation and the loss ratios of the clusters are measured so that the energy consumption can be effectively reduced. Reliable transmission can be provided in the clusters using a coordinate node. More details can be found at [p74,p75];P74,P75
RTK1;Data Redundancy;The most common scenarios of redundancy in information systems are data redundancy.All forms of data can be redundant -- files, databases, and objects in memory. Data and its replications can reside in the same machine or in different locations across machines, networks, and geographical areas. In a server-client system, data and its replications can all be on server side, or some on server side and some on client side, for example, client-side cache. Redundancy of data increases data's availability in case of failures due to unexpected heavy load, data node failures or lost connection between client and server;P76
RTK2;Processing Redundancy;Similar to data elements, processing elements can also be redundant in a system. This form of redundancy is also very common in enterprise information systems, for example, clustering of web servers and application servers. However, redundancy of processing elements is more difficult than data elements because of the problem of state. If a processing element needs to maintain state for an undergoing computation task, then it is difficult to make the processing element truly redundant. For if the processing element fails, there is no way to recover the task state that only exists in that element. There are two approaches to addressing this problem -- to make the task stateless or to restart the whole task from its initial state in case of failure;P76
RTK3;Element Replication;A common way to achieve redundancy is to create replicas of an element. The structure and functionality of a replica are exactly the same as that element so that they can substitute each other without problem. Follows some ways of implementing redundancy using [p87]: Design for failure: Acquiring more resources than needed and replace failed ones (DC A.8).Allowing component replication: State-machine (active) replication (DC A.11), Transactional replication (DC A.12), Virtual synchrony (DCA 13);P76,P87
RTK4;Hardware Clustering; High-availability clustering is a technique for protecting against failures by mirroring the whole computer rather than just a disk. In a clustered configuration, two or more identical computers (referred to as.nodes) are deployed in parallel and share the total workload between them. If any one of the nodes fails, one of the remaining nodes takes over its workload and processing can continue (although the transactions in progress at the failed node may have to be resubmitted) This process is known as failover. Follows some ways of implementing it using [p87]: VE Resolution location-oriented (DCA.1), VE Resolution domain-oriented (DC A.2), VE Resolution Semantic Web-oriented (DCA.3), VE Resolution Peer-to-Peer-oriented (DC A4);P87,P88
RTK5;Relaxing Transactional Consistency;To follow this tactic the loT-A recommend the use of the 'BASE architecture (DC A.14). The BASE (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent) architecture' is applicable in systems supporting distributed transactions with optimistic replication strategy. In this approach replicas of information are sent through a distributed system via transactions and eventual consistency' among the replicas is achieved by either the update reaches the replica or the replica retires from service. BASE requires some conflict resolution functionality and additional system resources in order to find failure in transactions. The approach is applicable for hiah performance desians.;p87
RTK6;Redundant Disk Architectures;Redundant disk architectures (such as RAID 1 or mirored disks) are a particularly common example. RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive or Independent Disks) architectures are available in a variety of configurations, known as RAID levels, which variously provide resilience through mimoring, improved performance through striping, and/or error correction. As shown in the diagram below, disk writes are applied to each side of the mirror, whereas reads come from only one side (or in some configurations, whichever side can return the information with the least amount of head movement). If either disk fails, the other can continue on its own until the faulty disk is replaced and resynchronized.;P88
RTK7;Redundant Power Supply Techniques;Redundant power is a critical component in high availability systems. In the simplest solution, two power supplies can drive a load through diodes to OR their outputs together. In this way, the power supplies can either share the load or have one active and the other in standby. A field effect transistor (FET) ORing controller is a more practical solution because it avoids the diode voltage drop, power Ioss and heat dissipation. More creative and economical systems can be configured with the low voltage loss MOSFET. Examples of redundant power supply Lconfiaurations farsen/er annlications are discussedin IP771;P77
RTK8;N-Version Programming;At least two programs or components are independently developed for the same specification in n-version programming. Different versions are sensitive to different system failures because of their inter-independence, and therefore n-version programming can make a system tolerant to more unexpected failures.;P76
RTK9;Serendipitous Redundancy by Reuse;Serendipitous redundancy happens whenthe function of a failed component can be partially substituted with a different component that was designed to achieve a totally different goal from the failed one. Serendipitous redundancy is possible only if (1) those two components share some common functionality, and (2) their interfaces to provide the common functionality are the same.;P76
SPTK1;Intrusion Prevention System;To follow this tactic the Cumulative-Sum-based Intrusion Prevention System (CSIPS). can be applied. It which detects maliciov behaviors, attacks and distnbuted attacks launched to remote cients and local hosts based on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm p3) In addition to the use of IPS the (p7] describes the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (1DS) techniques propose for detecting the presence ofjammers and numerous mechanisms which attempt to protect the network from jamming attacks.;P5,P7
SPKT2;Source Bootstrapping;Bootstrapping is a process in which one device is associated or connected with a part of network or similar devices. During the bootstrapping phase, a unique identity and other security parameters are associated with each device thing. Secure bootstrapping ensures that only authenticated devices access the network. The simplest mechanism for carying out the initial setup (security parameters, node identity) is via physical interface (USB, wire, chip contact, etc.). Wireless bootstrapping may lead to eavesdropping although it can be avoided by using advanced cryptographic mechanisms which provide confidentiality. To optimize the key distribution mechanism, several key management schemes have been proposed in literature for WSNs [p6], to support secure communication and authentication among WSNs devices.;P6
SPTK3;Smart Antennas;The p[47] proposed the use ot smart antennas against malicious eavesdroppers. The p[47] proposed a suite ot strategies that use arays of amays to provide considerable reductions in the exposure region. Exposure region that refers to the area within which an eavesdropper can access and decode the signals being transmitted. More details in [p47].;P47
SPTK4;Data Cryptography;Like traditional networks, Wireless sensorS applications require protection against eavesdropping. alteration, and packet injection. In order to achieve this protection, data cryptography can prevent these security issues. The p48] describes countermeasures that can be applyıed to IoT.;p48
SPTK5;Source Booting in Physical Layer;Authentication and the integrity of the software on the device should be verified using cryptographic hash algorithms, which would provide digital signatures. However, because of the low processing power on most of the devices and their need for ultra-low power consumption most cryptographic hash algorithms cannot be implemented, apart from NH and WH cryptographic hash functions that are optimal for ultra-low power consumption devices.;P60
SPTK6;Device Authentication in Physical Layer;When a new device is introduced to the network, it should authenticate itself before receiving or transmitting data, to ensure it is identified corectly betore authorization and keeping malicious devices out of the system.;P60
SPTK7;Data Integrity in Physical Layer;Eror detection mechanisms should be provided at each device, to ensure no tampering of sensitive data occurs. Low power consumption mechanisms like Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC), Checksum, Parity Bit are prefered, but for more secure eror detection method WH cryptographic hash function should be applied.;P60
SPTK8;Data Confidentiality in Physical Layer;All RFID Tags, IDs and data should be encrypted on each device before transmission of data to ensure contidentiality. However, because of the ultra-low power consumption, strong cryptographic encryption functions like AES cannot be implemented. Instead Blowfish or RSA have lower power consumption and less processing power and can be successfully implemented on the physical layer devices.;P60
SPTK9;Anonimity in Physical Layer;In some cases hiding sensitive infomation like the location and identity of nodes is crucial. Although Zero-Knowledge approach would be the optimal solution for anonymity, it cannot be implemented on low power device as it is a very strong algorithm and needs a lot of processing power, hence K-Anonymity approach best fits the job for low power devices such as the devices used in an IoT system.;P60
SPTK10;Data Privacy in Network Layer;Illegal access to the sensor nodes can be prevented, using authentication mechanisms and point to point encryption.;P60
SPTK11;Routing Security in Network Layer;Secure routing is vital to the acceptance and use of sensor networks for many applications, but the majority of used routing protocols are insecure. However, security of routing can be ensured by providing multiple paths for the data routing which improves the ability of the system to detect an error and keep performing upon any known of failure in the system. Also, encryption and authentication mechanisms increase the security level of routing data.;P60
SPTK12;Data Integrity in Network Layer;Using cryptographic hash functions, the integrity of the data received on the other end is confimed. In case of prove of tampering of data, error correction mechanisms could be introduced to mitigate the problem.;P60
SPTK13;Data Security in App Layer;Authentication Encryption and integrity mechanisms are citical at this level for insuring the privacy of the whole system and protecting against data theft, it prevents unauthorized access to the system and ensures the confidentiality of the system data.;P60
SPTK14;Access Control Lists in App Layer;Setting up policies and pemissions of who can access and control the lol system, is a crucial part as this ensures the privacy of the data, and the well being of the system. ACLs can block or allow incoming or out going traffic, and give or block access to requests rom different users inside or outside of the network.;P60
SPTK15;Firewalls in App Layer;This is an extra effective layer of security that will help block attacks that authentication, encryption and ACLs would failed to do so. Authentication and encryption passwords can be broken if weak passwords were selected. A firewall can filter packets as they are received, blocking unwanted packets, unfriendly login attempts, and DoS attacks before even authentication process begins.;P60
SPTK16;Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware and Anti-Adware in App Layer;Secunty software like antivirus or anti spyware is important for the reliability, security, integnty and confidentiality of the IoT system.;P60
SPTK17;Autonomic Cyber Security Management Framework;To follow this article the [p8] can be applied. This work introduces an autonomic model-based cyber security management approach for the Internet ot Things (IoT) ecosystems. The approach aims at realizing a self-protecting system, which has the ability to autonomously estimate, detect, and react to cyber attacks at an early stage. The approach integrates various model-based techniques including: 1) real-time estimation and baseline security controls to predict and eliminate potential cyber attacks. 2) Data analysis to indentify and classify attacks, and 3) a multicriteria  ptimization method to select the optimal active response for deploying countemeasures while maintaining system functions. The prototype framework has been developed with a master controller virtual machine, which can be configured for various platfoms. Besides estimating, detecting, and protecting against known attacks, the approach can also learn signatures of unknown attacks in real time. Unknown attacks are identified for future protection by updating detection algorithms with the underlying signatures. In our framework design, the main protection modules are installed on the MC-VM, which ensures that the self-protection mechanism continues to work even if the underlying system is compromised. A multitier web application case study is presented. Our self-protecting system successfully secured the web application from various known and unknown attacks. Below is a figure of main components of the autonomic security management framework. More details in [p8].;P8
SPTK18;Classical Countermeasures for Self Protection;Security solutions have been classified as either self-protecting or self-healing, in relation to the autonomic mechanism used for mitigation. Self-protecting solutions tollow a passive approach and attempt to prevent security threats betrore they happen. Ihis is done using various cryptographic techniques, with the knowledge of how common attacks are executed. In the case of self-healing solutions, the specific counter-measures for mitigation are taken only after the attack has been detected. Reactive measures are easier to achieve than protective measures, as typically the attacks aim confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity or privacy. Nevertheless, it is important to include protective mechanisms as well supplementing the reactive mechanisms, resulting in what we call as hybrid schemes. In p[15] is presented countemeasures;P15
SPTK19;Enhance Location Privacy;Vast deployment will make RFID a pervasive technology. Thus, security and privacy are import issues to be considered. Many location-aware applications emerge. Systems are capable of tracking all of our movements and recording anything. This is done in the name of convenience or due to economic reasons. Legislation must ensure that privacy of the individual is still protected, researchers must develop the required techniques. An overview of curent approaches for enhancement of privacy has been given above and their capability of handling the various threats RFID technology faces has been explained. The [p24] proposed a hash-based scheme with a high inherent security rendering it a useful technique for all kinds of applications where static identifiers are used curently and location privacy is an issue. The main benefit of the proposed scheme is its simplicity: It only requires implementation of a hash function in the tag and data management at the backend and does not rely on random numbers generated by the tag, strong symmetrnic or even asymmetrnic encryption. It offers a high degree of location privacy and is resistant to many forms of attacks like eavesdropping. Further, only a single message exchange is required, the communications channel need not be reliable. the reader third party need not be trusted, and no long-term secrets need to be stored in tags. Most ot the denoted drawbacks have already been solved and the solutions will be published in subsequent publications.;P24
SPTK20;Countermeasures for Time Synchronization Attacks;In P[28] is proposed countemeasures for single hop networks and multi-hop networks separately. Each time synchronization protocol facilitates single hop synchronization by having a node periodically broadcast its local version or the global time and allowing the other nodes to synchronize their clocks to that time. Since multihop time symchronization algorithms are all extensions to that basic bulding block, our proposals tor multihop networks are a superset of our proposals for single hop networks.;P28
SPTK21;Routing Protocol;AODV, DSR, TORA and OLSR ad-hoc routing protocols.;P29
SPTK22;Threshold Cryptography Based Group Authentication;Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm where the devices around us (persistent and non persistent) are connected to each other to provide seamless communication, and contextual services. In the IoT, each device cannot be authenticated in the short time due to unbounded number of devices. Equally, it is difficult to get receipt of their authentication request at the same time. Therefore, secure, and efficient group authentication scheme is required that authenticates a group of devices at once in the context of resource constrained IoT. The p[30] presents novel Threshold Cryptography-based Group Authentication (TCGA) scheme for the IoT which verifies authenticity of all the devices taking part in the group communication. The proposed TCGA scheme is implemented for WiFi environment, and the result shows that TCGA scheme is lightweight, and alleviates the efect of battery exhaustion attack. The p[30] also presents time analysis, and formal security analysis of TCGA scheme which shows that the proposed TCGA scheme is safe from the replay, man-in-the-middle attack, and is scalable in nature.;P30
SPTK23;Sybil Limit;Decentralized distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a malicious user pretends to have multiple identities (called sybil nodes). without a trusted central authority, defending against sybil attacks is quite chalenging. Among the small number ot decentralized approaches, the recent SybilGuard protocol of p[38] leverages a key insight on social networks to bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthemore, Sybil Guard assumes that social networks are fast mixing, which has never been confirmed in the real world. The p[38] presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of O(sqrt(n)), or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that SybilLimit1' guarantee is at most a log(n) factor away from optimal, when considering approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world social networks. The p[38] provide the first evidence that real-world social networks are indeed fast mixing. This validates the fundamental assumption behind SybillLimit's and SybilGuard s approach;P38
SPTK24;Sybyl Guard;Peer-to-peer and other decentralized, distributed systems are known to be particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks. In a sybil attack, a malicious user obtains multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct nodes in the System. By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system, the malicious user is able to out vote the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks. Our protocol is based on the socil network among user identities, Where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately-small cut in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number ot identities a malicious user can create. we show the effectiveness of SybilGuard both analytically and experimentally;P39
SPTK25;Lightweight Defense Scheme;The p[90] proposed a Lightweaght Defense Scheme against Selective Forwarding Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks that can be used in IoT application. According to characteristics of easy positioning the nodes around transmission paths in a structured topology made of hexagonal mesh, the nodes around transmission path are used to monitor packet transmission of its neighbor nodes, judge the attackers location and resend the packets dropped by the attackers. The method is etfective in detecting selective forwarding attacks to ensure reliable packet delivery. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme consumes less energy and storage. More details in p[90]. Advantages: The routing discover scheme is dynamically generating path which makes adversary difficult to launch attack. There is no traftic overhead to detect malicious node. Neighbour nodes are judging the malicious nature of a node, so no need of shared key between every two nodes in the network, which reduces storage required. Eficient utilization of energy since only one node is active at a time in each RC. Drawbacks: How much trustworthy a monitor node is? -If a node is malicious, the scheme did not explain whether to remove complete RC or only that node from routing discovery process. If we are removing complete RC then not efficient resource utilization. -Routing is a probability based one which is not an optimal one. We require GPS to acquire the locations of nodes which makes network costly.;p45,p90
SPTK26;Multi Data Flow Scheme;Multi Data Flow Scheme is a single scheme which defends against selective forwarding attack. The scheme uses multiflow topologies to defend the attack. In multi-dataflow scheme, the whole network is divided into different data topologies that makes, a sensor node belonging to one topology can communicate and send information only through nodes of the same topology. This division can be done at diferent times. Generaly division takes place at deployment time. If not then the nodes can randomly choose a topology number after deployment phase. The condition in this scheme is that every topology has to cover the sensing area completely. More details in [p91]. Advantages Of this Scheme: In this scheme no need of any additional hard-ware/software is needed to mitigate the attack. There won't be any packet loss or delay due to attack due to which packet delivery ratio will be high. Drawbacks: Network cost is high. Network lifetime will be low since due to multi data transmission. If attack occurs in all topologies then there wont be any defense from attack;P45,P91
SPTK27;Flooding Attack Prevention;To defend routing protocols against the Ad hoc Flooding attack, we develop a generic secure component, called Flooding Attack Prevention (AP) which can be applied to AODV routing protocol to allow that protocol to resist the rushing attack. Flooding Attack Prevention (FAC), a generic defense against the Ad hoc Flooding Attack. When the intruder broadcasts exceeding packets or Route Request, the immediate neighbors or the intruder record the rate of Route Request. Once the threshold is exceeded, nodes deny any future request packets from the intruder. More details in p49;P49
SPKT28;Vulnerability Scan;Mitigation solutions include constant vulnerability scans using malware pattem classification [p50] and risk mitigation services. The pattem classification can be done using the autonomic control loop component of "Analysis" following which the autonomic "execution" of the mitigation service can be performed;p50
SPTK29;Clustering Protocols;Clustering protocols can be used agonist to railures and attacks. The Pertectly anonymous data aggregation protocol p[92] can be used in IoT Application. Clusterng and data aggregation in wireless sensor networks improves scalability, and helps the efficient use of scarce resources. Yet, these mechanisms also introduce some security issues. In particular, aggregator nodes become attractive targets of physical destruction and jamming attacks. In order to mitigate this problem, [p92] propose a new private aggregator node election protocol that hides the identity of the elected aggregator nodes both from external eavesdroppers and from compromised nodes participating in the protocol. p[92] also propose a private data aggregation protocol and a corresponding private query protocol which allows the aggregators to collect sensor readings and respond to queries of the base station, respectively, without revealing any useful information about their identity to external eavesdroppers and to compromised nodes. Others Clustering protocols are discussed in p[5l] and can be applied in IoT applications;P51,P92
SPTK30;Risk Assessment;It is fundamental tor the continuing security of the system, by discovering new threats, applying Updates and patches to the firmware on the system devices, as well as providing improvements in the existing security structure. Risk Assessment: b) Finding New Threats, c) Applying Updates d) Applying Patches, e) Providing Improvements and Upgrading Systems.;P60
SPTK31;Securing the Premises;Securing the premises is perhaps the most important security feature that IoT needs, as it physically secures the IoT devices, i.e. sensor nodes, computers, firewalls, data servers, etc. The security of the loT devices is achieved by using Physical Barriers to block any unauthorized people, Intrusion Detection systems to monitor any strange benavior, Access Control to make sure only legible users enters the premises of the IoT and even Security personnel to ensure total security of the IoT devices. Securing the IoT Premises: a) Physical Barriers b) Intrusion Detection Alarms c)Monitoring Devices d)Access Control Devices e)Securty Personnel;P60
SPTK32;IEEE Standards Solutions;The IEEE provides standard mechanisms for the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers which are useul in implementation ot a smart city. There exist three families that can provide low-power and short-range IoT operation for a smart city [7]. IEEE 802.15.4: Important characteristics include real-time quality by guarantying time slots, collision dodging through CSMA/CA and merged assistance for secure communication. Moreove, the devices include power management functions, for example energy detection and link quality. IEEE 802.15.1 is used in Bluetooth. IEEE 802.15.11 This technology is provided from WiFi Alliance, a trade association in control of the certifying products if they adjust to particular standards of interpretability. The WiFi Protected Access (WPA) [56] is a security protocol that has become the regulation for providing security .11 networks. Here by using an already shared encryption key (PSK) or digital certificates, the WPA algorithm Temporal Key Integnty Protocol (TKIP) encrypts information providing authentication to the particular networks. The WPA algorithm (TKIP) further improved upon to the new WPA2 [57] [56] that utilizes more securer encryption algorithm that is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Moreover this protocol also uses better and advanced kev distribution techniques., which help in improved session security to avoid eavesdropping;P111
SPTK33;Tag Blocking, Tag Sleeping and Selective Blocking;It is important to discuss various techniques and strategies that may play part in better security performance of RFID in a smart city. Privacy protection is an important need and right of the citizens and as discussed previously, that tag killing may play role in privacy protection but this also may lead to loss data permanently. A better option is tag sleeping When the tag does not need to to be read, it is put to sleep temporarily [45]. There is another concept of tag blocking and selective blocking [40].;P111
SPTK34;Re-encryption and Minimalist Cryptography;Privacy protection is an important need and right of the citizens and as discussed previously, that tag killing may play role in privacy protection but this also may lead to loss data pemanently. Other techniques include re-labeling approach, re-encryption and minimalist cryptography [45];P111
SPTK35;Data Coding and Multiple Re-Transmission;The interterence problems in the RFID system can be dealt by data coding, multiple re transmission and data integnty check.;P111
SPTK36;Hash Lock and Hash Link;Hash-Lock and Hash Link techniques are also important as they provide better authentication. There are other authentication techniques based on hash such as ID exchange and distributed RFID challenge/answer authentication [39];P111
DRTK1;Preventive Measures;It is an Availability and Resilience Perspective tactic of IoT-A. The choice Preventive measure (DC A.15) is aimed at preventing disastrous events, like data-loss, from occurring. To achieve this, data is replicated to have identical copies in reserve in case the original data gets lost. Consistency among the data replicas needs to be assured by the design. To minimize risks the replicas are better stored at different locations that the original data, preferably in the cloud.;P87
DRTK2;Detective Measures;It is a Availability and Resilience Perspective tactic of IoT-A. "Detective measures (DC A.16) aim at detecting or discovering unwanted events by monitoring indicators for unwanted events, like measured values that exceed a certain range. This strategy requires an Information Model of those unwanted events together with their indicators that are used to detect the unwanted event. The event detection should be operated independent of the subsystem that is monitored to make sure the unwanted events can be detected.;P87
DRTK3;Corrective Measures;It is an Availability and Resilience Perspective tactic of IoT-A. The design choice "Corrective measures (DC A.17) is aimed at corecting or restoring systems after disastrous events have occured. Assuming the previous two choices have been implemented, meaning the preventive methods have been applied and the disastrous event has been detected corectly, the system can be restored to working order again. Backups of system configurations that have worked corectly before are restored. A configuration history provides the functionality needed for restoring working configurations. The system corection process needs to be operated independently of the system to be restored.;IoT-A
DRTK4;Business Continuity Plan (BCP);Applyinga Business Continuity Plan meta-model is a way to ensure the ability to operate in spite of unforeseen events and to quickly recover from any type of business interuption. A BCP meta-model formalizes essential aspects and concepts of Business Continuity Management in a socio-technical system. The BCP meta-model is generic enough to be applied to any healthcare organization and Iot Application.;P84
DRTK5;Backup Strategies;A good backup strategy is the best defense against data loss. A backup strategy or backup policy is essentially a set of procedures that you prepare and implement to protect your important digital content from hard drive failures, virus attacks and other events or disasters. Features of a Good Backup Strategy are: a) Able to recover from data loss in all circumstances like hard drive failure, virus attacks, theft, accidental deletes or data entry erors, sabotage, fire, flood, earth quakes and other natural disasters. b) Able to recover to an earlier state if necessary like due to data entry errors or accidental deletes. c) Able to recover as quickly as possible with minimum effort, cost and data loss. d) Require minimum ongoing human interaction and maintenance after the initial setup. Hence able to run automated or semi-automated. Planning Your Backup Strategy: 1) What to Backup. 2) Where to Backup to, 3) When to Backup, 4) Backup Types, 5) Compression and Encryption, 6) Testing your backup and 7) Backup utilities and services.;P85,P86
SCTK1;Dynamic Configuration;Dynamic system reconfigurability can be achieved with replacing the application software or alter its configuration on-the-fly. One method to replace an application from live mote is to utilize dynamic linking and loading to change required application modules. Traditionally most of the configuration of the application is hardcoded to the application binary image, which must be replaced if a configuration change is desired. Replacement of the binary image is costly operation in terms of resource use. If application logic is separated from the configuration it is easier to replace only needed parts of the configuration to change behavior of the application, if the desired change in behavior is small enough so the old application logic can handle the new behavior too. Replacing configuration is also cheaper operation in tems of resource use than replacement of whole binary image. Support for dynamic changes on the system configuration is required so the system can be adjusted for new conditions. Reconfigurable system is also the starting point for development of self-managing system that can adjust its operation automatically in response to changes in its environment.;P1
SCTK2;LEACH;The use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is anticipated to bring enomous changes in data gathering, processing and dissemination for different environments and applications. However, a WSN is a power constrained system, since nodes nun on limited power batteries which shorten its lifespan. Prolonging the network lifetime depends on efticient management of sensing node energy resource. Hierarchical routing protocols are best known in regad to energy efficiency. By using a clustering technique hierarchical routing protocols greatly minimize energy consumed in collecting and disseminating data. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the fundamental protocols in this class. The [p78] proposed Advanced LEACH (A-LEACH), a heterogeneous-energy protocol to decrease probability of failure nodes and to prolong the time interval before the death of the first node (we refer to as stability period) and increasing the lifetime in heterogeneous WSNs, which is crucial for many applications such as ToT applications.;P78
SCTK3;Dynamic Modulation Scaling;Dynamic modulation scaling (DMS) is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at node-level reconfiguration used to reconfigure modulation schemes in communication to achieve energy efficiency in WSN. DMS has been utilized to reduce energy consum ption in wireless communication, where the communication energy was reduced by changing the modulation level of the communication at the cost of increased transmission time. Significant research and development efforts have been made on the scheduling algorithm for DMS to provide significant energy savings while maintaining the time constraints. The [p79] explain some DMS techniques that can be used in loT application.;P79
SCTK4;Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS);Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) Is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at node-level reconfiguration used to reconfigure voltages and operating frequency of processors to achieve energy efficiency in WSN. The utilization of DVS technique required consideration of time constraints because the changes in operating frequency interfered with the computation time given a fixed computation workload. Hence, a scheduling algorithm was usually accompanied with DVS technique to guarantee the time constraint, especially in real-time applications. Researchers have worked on scheduling algorithms for using DVS in different applications. The p[79] explain some DVS techniques that can be used in loT a pplication.;P79
SCTK5;Adaptative Sampling Rate;Adaptive Sampling Rate Is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at node-level reconfiguration used to change the sampling rate of sensors to achieve energy efficiency in WSN.;P80
SCTK6;Intelligent Node Activation; Intelligent Node Activation is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at network-level reconfiguration used to change sensor node status to achieve energy efficiency in WSN. Intelligent node activation determines node activity to minimize redundant energy usage within the network. It involved redundant deployment of sensor nodes to allow a sensor node to go into sleep mode without degrading network performance. This reduced the overall energy consumption of the network by taking redundant nodes off line and scheduling active/sleep states of the sensor nodes.;P79,P81
SHTK1;SHA Based on MAPE-k loop;Fault tolerance is essential in the IoT. The number of vulnerable systems and attacks will increase, so there is a need to develop intrusion detection and prevention systems to protect the components of the IoT. The growth of connected devices in IoT makes the human intervention less effective. Autonomic computing aims to reduce the human intervention in complex systems, like the human nervous system controls autonomically some functions of body, like the digestive system. The proposed architecture defines five components, distributed between the monitoring phase, analysis phase and knowledge component, to add the property of self-healing into the Internet of Things. The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) is combined with an Artificial Intelligence component to allow the DCA learning the role of each Infomation sensed. The architecture described in this paper can implement a self-healing system in IoT nodes distributing roles between them in order to ease design of self-healing systems for IoT. Below we can see SELF-HEALING ARCHITECTURE based on MAPE-K loop that can be used in IoT application. More details in [p9];P9
SHTK2;SHõWA;The complexity of systems is considered an obstacle to the progress of the IT industry. Autonomic computing is presented as the altemative to cope with the growing complexity. It is a holistic approach, in which the systems are able to configure, heal, optimize, and protect by themselves. Web-based applications are an example of systems where the complexity is high. The number of components, their interoperability, and workload variations are factors that may lead to perfomance failures or unavailability scenarios. The occurrence of these scenarios affects the revenue and reputation of businesses that rely on these types of applications. The [p12] presented a self-healing framework for Web-based applications (SH6WA). SH3WA is composed by several modules, which monitor the application, analyze the data to detect and pinpoint anomalies, and execute recovery actions autonomously. The monitoring is done by a small aspect-oriented programming agent. This agent does not require changes to the application source code and includes adaptive and selective algorithms to regulate the level of monitoring. The anomalies are detected and pinpointed by means of statistical corelation. The data analysis detects changes in the server response time and analyzes if those changes are corelated with the workload or are due to a perfomance anomaly. In the presence of perfomance anomalies, the data analysis pinpoints the anomaly. Upon the pinpointing of anomalies, SH3WA executes a recovery procedure. Below we can see the Building blocks of the SHôWA framework that can be used in IoT application. More details in [p12].;P12
SHTK3;ACOSHR;Recent advances in Compact and wireless embedded Systems coupled wvith the technological innovations in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems(MEMS), Wireless Communications and networks paved the way for the development of small, resource constrained devices called Sensor Nodes (SNs). Perfomance of Sensor Node is highly dependent on the effective and efficient usage of the available limited resources with it, leading to maximum lifetime of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) which is a primary concem of wSNs. The depletion of a SN energy leads to change in topology of WSNs often over a period of time. Therefore, protocols which consider the dynamic nature of WSNs are crucial for improving the netwok lifetime. The [p13] proposed bio inspired Ant Colony optimization based Self healing routing scheme inspired by swam Intelligence technique to improve lifetime of a WSN. ACOSHR finds path by launching a colony of artificial ants that move through wireless links between source and destination. ACOSHR detemines path by considering both the remaining energy in the nodes and shorter lengths using the hop distance. Thus, ACOSHR maximizes the lifetime of the WSN. Below we can see the Flow chart for ACOSHR that can be used in IoT application More details in [p13];P13
SHTK4;Classical Counter Measures for Self Healing;Security solutions have been classified as either self-protecting or self-healing, in relation to the autonomic mechanism used for mitigation. Self-protecting solutions follow a passive approach and attempt to prevent security threats before they happen. This is done using various cryptographic techniques, with the knowledge of how common attacks are executed. In the case of self-healing solutions, the specific counter- measures for mitigation are taken only after the attack has been detected. Reactive measures are easier to achieve than protective measures, as typically the attacks aim confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity or privacy. Nevertheless, it is important to incude protective mechanisms as well supplementing the reactive mechanisms, resulting in what we call as hvbrid schemes. In [p15] is presented countemeasures.;P15
SHTK5;DEEJAM;Jamming is a very effective denial-of-service attack that renders most higher-layer secunty mechanisms mootyet it is often ignored in WSN design. The [p19] showed that an intemupt jamming attack is simple to perpetrate in software using a MICAzmote, is energy efficient and stealthy for the jammer, and completely disrupts communication. Thus, [p19] presented DEEJAM, a novel MAC-layer protocol for defeating stealthy jammers with IEEE 802.15.4-based hardware, to address this problematic area. It layers four defensivemechanisms to hide communication from a jammer, evade its search, and reduce its impact. DEEJAM defeated the other-wise devastating intemupt jammer, and achieves a packet delivery ratio of 88% in the presence ofa pulse jammer. More details in [p19];P19
SHTK6;Puzzle Schemes;Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are on the ise in recent years and many cryptographic cient puzzle schemes have been proposed for mitigating such attacks. Nonetheless, these schemes lack a strategy for setting the puzzle difficulty parameter which is an important issue for the legitimate users as they should not be unfairly delayed during low server loads. The [p32]. proposed a leaky bucket rate limiting queue mechanism to set the puzzle difficulty according to a queue delay. This mechanism will rate limit the number of incoming requests to prevent server overloading. As a result, DoS attackers have to spend more time to solve harder puzzles which reduces their rate of attack success. More details in [p32];P32
