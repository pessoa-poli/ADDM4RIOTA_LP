EETK1;SNBP;Simple Naive Bayes Prediction model (SNBP model) is a technique to remove unnecessary and redundant data, which saves he energy to be used for transmission of data in Wireless Sensor Networks and increases the life of network as data for  ransmission is reduced which saves that energy of sensor nodes.;P70

EETK5;Energy Efficient Data Aggregation technique;Energy Efficient Data Aggregation technique is a energy efficient routing protocol for WirelesSSensor Networks which is energy efficient and reliable. This technique is based on cluster formation and the loss ratios of the clusters are measured so that the energy consumption can be effectively reduced. Reliable transmission can be provided in the clusters using a coordinate node. More details can be found at [p74,p75];P74,P75
RTK1;Data Redundancy;The most common scenarios of redundancy in information systems are data redundancy.All forms of data can be redundant -- files, databases, and objects in memory. Data and its replications can reside in the same machine or in different locations across machines, networks, and geographical areas. In a server-client system, data and its replications can all be on server side, or some on server side and some on client side, for example, client-side cache. Redundancy of data increases data's availability in case of failures due to unexpected heavy load, data node failures or lost connection between client and server;P76
RTK2;Processing Redundancy;Similar to data elements, processing elements can also be redundant in a system. This form of redundancy is also very common in enterprise information systems, for example, clustering of web servers and application servers. However, redundancy of processing elements is more difficult than data elements because of the problem of state. If a processing element needs to maintain state for an undergoing computation task, then it is difficult to make the processing element truly redundant. For if the processing element fails, there is no way to recover the task state that only exists in that element. There are two approaches to addressing this problem -- to make the task stateless or to restart the whole task from its initial state in case of failure;P76
RTK3;Element Replication;A common way to achieve redundancy is to create replicas of an element. The structure and functionality of a replica are exactly the same as that element so that they can substitute each other without problem. Follows some ways of implementing redundancy using [p87]: Design for failure: Acquiring more resources than needed and replace failed ones (DC A.8).Allowing component replication: State-machine (active) replication (DC A.11), Transactional replication (DC A.12), Virtual synchrony (DCA 13);P76,P87
RTK4;Hardware Clustering; High-availability clustering is a technique for protecting against failures by mirroring the whole computer rather than just a disk. In a clustered configuration, two or more identical computers (referred to as.nodes) are deployed in parallel and share the total workload between them. If any one of the nodes fails, one of the remaining nodes takes over its workload and processing can continue (although the transactions in progress at the failed node may have to be resubmitted) This process is known as failover. Follows some ways of implementing it using [p87]: VE Resolution location-oriented (DCA.1), VE Resolution domain-oriented (DC A.2), VE Resolution Semantic Web-oriented (DCA.3), VE Resolution Peer-to-Peer-oriented (DC A4);P87,P88
RTK5;Relaxing Transactional Consistency;To follow this tactic the loT-A recommend the use of the 'BASE architecture (DC A.14). The BASE (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent) architecture' is applicable in systems supporting distributed transactions with optimistic replication strategy. In this approach replicas of information are sent through a distributed system via transactions and eventual consistency' among the replicas is achieved by either the update reaches the replica or the replica retires from service. BASE requires some conflict resolution functionality and additional system resources in order to find failure in transactions. The approach is applicable for hiah performance desians.;p87
RTK6;Redundant Disk Architectures;Redundant disk architectures (such as RAID 1 or mirored disks) are a particularly common example. RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive or Independent Disks) architectures are available in a variety of configurations, known as RAID levels, which variously provide resilience through mimoring, improved performance through striping, and/or error correction. As shown in the diagram below, disk writes are applied to each side of the mirror, whereas reads come from only one side (or in some configurations, whichever side can return the information with the least amount of head movement). If either disk fails, the other can continue on its own until the faulty disk is replaced and resynchronized.;P88
RTK7;Redundant Power Supply Techniques;Redundant power is a critical component in high availability systems. In the simplest solution, two power supplies can drive a load through diodes to OR their outputs together. In this way, the power supplies can either share the load or have one active and the other in standby. A field effect transistor (FET) ORing controller is a more practical solution because it avoids the diode voltage drop, power Ioss and heat dissipation. More creative and economical systems can be configured with the low voltage loss MOSFET. Examples of redundant power supply Lconfiaurations farsen/er annlications are discussedin IP771;P77
RTK8;N-Version Programming;At least two programs or components are independently developed for the same specification in n-version programming. Different versions are sensitive to different system failures because of their inter-independence, and therefore n-version programming can make a system tolerant to more unexpected failures.;P76
RTK9;Serendipitous Redundancy by Reuse;Serendipitous redundancy happens whenthe function of a failed component can be partially substituted with a different component that was designed to achieve a totally different goal from the failed one. Serendipitous redundancy is possible only if (1) those two components share some common functionality, and (2) their interfaces to provide the common functionality are the same.;P76
SPTK1;Intrusion Prevention System;To follow this tactic the Cumulative-Sum-based Intrusion Prevention System (CSIPS). can be applied. It which detects maliciov behaviors, attacks and distnbuted attacks launched to remote cients and local hosts based on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm p3) In addition to the use of IPS the (p7] describes the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (1DS) techniques propose for detecting the presence ofjammers and numerous mechanisms which attempt to protect the network from jamming attacks.;P5,P7
SPTK2;Source Bootstrapping;Bootstrapping is a process in which one device is associated or connected with a part of network or similar devices. During the bootstrapping phase, a unique identity and other security parameters are associated with each device thing. Secure bootstrapping ensures that only authenticated devices access the network. The simplest mechanism for carying out the initial setup (security parameters, node identity) is via physical interface (USB, wire, chip contact, etc.). Wireless bootstrapping may lead to eavesdropping although it can be avoided by using advanced cryptographic mechanisms which provide confidentiality. To optimize the key distribution mechanism, several key management schemes have been proposed in literature for WSNs [p6], to support secure communication and authentication among WSNs devices.;P6
SPTK3;Smart Antennas;The p[47] proposed the use ot smart antennas against malicious eavesdroppers. The p[47] proposed a suite ot strategies that use arays of amays to provide considerable reductions in the exposure region. Exposure region that refers to the area within which an eavesdropper can access and decode the signals being transmitted. More details in [p47].;P47
SPTK4;Data Cryptography;Like traditional networks, Wireless sensorS applications require protection against eavesdropping. alteration, and packet injection. In order to achieve this protection, data cryptography can prevent these security issues. The p48] describes countermeasures that can be applyÄ±ed to IoT.;p48
SPTK5;Source Booting in Physical Layer;Authentication and the integrity of the software on the device should be verified using cryptographic hash algorithms, which would provide digital signatures. However, because of the low processing power on most of the devices and their need for ultra-low power consumption most cryptographic hash algorithms cannot be implemented, apart from NH and WH cryptographic hash functions that are optimal for ultra-low power consumption devices.;P60
SPTK6;Device Authentication in Physical Layer;When a new device is introduced to the network, it should authenticate itself before receiving or transmitting data, to ensure it is identified corectly betore authorization and keeping malicious devices out of the system.;P60
SPTK7;Data Integrity in Physical Layer;Eror detection mechanisms should be provided at each device, to ensure no tampering of sensitive data occurs. Low power consumption mechanisms like Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC), Checksum, Parity Bit are prefered, but for more secure eror detection method WH cryptographic hash function should be applied.;P60
SPTK8;Data Confidentiality in Physical Layer;All RFID Tags, IDs and data should be encrypted on each device before transmission of data to ensure contidentiality. However, because of the ultra-low power consumption, strong cryptographic encryption functions like AES cannot be implemented. Instead Blowfish or RSA have lower power consumption and less processing power and can be successfully implemented on the physical layer devices.;P60
SPTK9;Anonimity in Physical Layer;In some cases hiding sensitive infomation like the location and identity of nodes is crucial. Although Zero-Knowledge approach would be the optimal solution for anonymity, it cannot be implemented on low power device as it is a very strong algorithm and needs a lot of processing power, hence K-Anonymity approach best fits the job for low power devices such as the devices used in an IoT system.;P60
SPTK10;Data Privacy in Network Layer;Illegal access to the sensor nodes can be prevented, using authentication mechanisms and point to point encryption.;P60
SPTK11;Routing Security in Network Layer;Secure routing is vital to the acceptance and use of sensor networks for many applications, but the majority of used routing protocols are insecure. However, security of routing can be ensured by providing multiple paths for the data routing which improves the ability of the system to detect an error and keep performing upon any known of failure in the system. Also, encryption and authentication mechanisms increase the security level of routing data.;P60
SPTK12;Data Integrity in Network Layer;Using cryptographic hash functions, the integrity of the data received on the other end is confimed. In case of prove of tampering of data, error correction mechanisms could be introduced to mitigate the problem.;P60
SPTK13;Data Security in App Layer;Authentication Encryption and integrity mechanisms are citical at this level for insuring the privacy of the whole system and protecting against data theft, it prevents unauthorized access to the system and ensures the confidentiality of the system data.;P60
SPTK14;Access Control Lists in App Layer;Setting up policies and pemissions of who can access and control the IoT system, is a crucial part as this ensures the privacy of the data, and the well being of the system. ACLs can block or allow incoming or out going traffic, and give or block access to requests rom different users inside or outside of the network.;P60
SPTK15;Firewalls in App Layer;This is an extra effective layer of security that will help block attacks that authentication, encryption and ACLs would failed to do so. Authentication and encryption passwords can be broken if weak passwords were selected. A firewall can filter packets as they are received, blocking unwanted packets, unfriendly login attempts, and DoS attacks before even authentication process begins.;P60
SPTK16;Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware and Anti-Adware in App Layer;Secunty software like antivirus or anti spyware is important for the reliability, security, integnty and confidentiality of the IoT system.;P60
SPTK17;Autonomic Cyber Security Management Framework;To follow this article the [p8] can be applied. This work introduces an autonomic model-based cyber security management approach for the Internet ot Things (IoT) ecosystems. The approach aims at realizing a self-protecting system, which has the ability to autonomously estimate, detect, and react to cyber attacks at an early stage. The approach integrates various model-based techniques including: 1) real-time estimation and baseline security controls to predict and eliminate potential cyber attacks. 2) Data analysis to indentify and classify attacks, and 3) a multicriteria  ptimization method to select the optimal active response for deploying countemeasures while maintaining system functions. The prototype framework has been developed with a master controller virtual machine, which can be configured for various platfoms. Besides estimating, detecting, and protecting against known attacks, the approach can also learn signatures of unknown attacks in real time. Unknown attacks are identified for future protection by updating detection algorithms with the underlying signatures. In our framework design, the main protection modules are installed on the MC-VM, which ensures that the self-protection mechanism continues to work even if the underlying system is compromised. A multitier web application case study is presented. Our self-protecting system successfully secured the web application from various known and unknown attacks. Below is a figure of main components of the autonomic security management framework. More details in [p8].;P8
SPTK18;Classical Countermeasures for Self Protection;Security solutions have been classified as either self-protecting or self-healing, in relation to the autonomic mechanism used for mitigation. Self-protecting solutions tollow a passive approach and attempt to prevent security threats betrore they happen. Ihis is done using various cryptographic techniques, with the knowledge of how common attacks are executed. In the case of self-healing solutions, the specific counter-measures for mitigation are taken only after the attack has been detected. Reactive measures are easier to achieve than protective measures, as typically the attacks aim confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity or privacy. Nevertheless, it is important to include protective mechanisms as well supplementing the reactive mechanisms, resulting in what we call as hybrid schemes. In p[15] is presented countemeasures;P15
SPTK19;Enhance Location Privacy;Vast deployment will make RFID a pervasive technology. Thus, security and privacy are import issues to be considered. Many location-aware applications emerge. Systems are capable of tracking all of our movements and recording anything. This is done in the name of convenience or due to economic reasons. Legislation must ensure that privacy of the individual is still protected, researchers must develop the required techniques. An overview of curent approaches for enhancement of privacy has been given above and their capability of handling the various threats RFID technology faces has been explained. The [p24] proposed a hash-based scheme with a high inherent security rendering it a useful technique for all kinds of applications where static identifiers are used curently and location privacy is an issue. The main benefit of the proposed scheme is its simplicity: It only requires implementation of a hash function in the tag and data management at the backend and does not rely on random numbers generated by the tag, strong symmetrnic or even asymmetrnic encryption. It offers a high degree of location privacy and is resistant to many forms of attacks like eavesdropping. Further, only a single message exchange is required, the communications channel need not be reliable. the reader third party need not be trusted, and no long-term secrets need to be stored in tags. Most ot the denoted drawbacks have already been solved and the solutions will be published in subsequent publications.;P24
SPTK20;Countermeasures for Time Synchronization Attacks;In P[28] is proposed countemeasures for single hop networks and multi-hop networks separately. Each time synchronization protocol facilitates single hop synchronization by having a node periodically broadcast its local version or the global time and allowing the other nodes to synchronize their clocks to that time. Since multihop time symchronization algorithms are all extensions to that basic bulding block, our proposals tor multihop networks are a superset of our proposals for single hop networks.;P28
SPTK21;Routing Protocol;AODV, DSR, TORA and OLSR ad-hoc routing protocols.;P29
SPTK22;Threshold Cryptography Based Group Authentication;Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm where the devices around us (persistent and non persistent) are connected to each other to provide seamless communication, and contextual services. In the IoT, each device cannot be authenticated in the short time due to unbounded number of devices. Equally, it is difficult to get receipt of their authentication request at the same time. Therefore, secure, and efficient group authentication scheme is required that authenticates a group of devices at once in the context of resource constrained IoT. The p[30] presents novel Threshold Cryptography-based Group Authentication (TCGA) scheme for the IoT which verifies authenticity of all the devices taking part in the group communication. The proposed TCGA scheme is implemented for WiFi environment, and the result shows that TCGA scheme is lightweight, and alleviates the efect of battery exhaustion attack. The p[30] also presents time analysis, and formal security analysis of TCGA scheme which shows that the proposed TCGA scheme is safe from the replay, man-in-the-middle attack, and is scalable in nature.;P30
SPTK23;Sybil Limit;Decentralized distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a malicious user pretends to have multiple identities (called sybil nodes). without a trusted central authority, defending against sybil attacks is quite chalenging. Among the small number ot decentralized approaches, the recent SybilGuard protocol of p[38] leverages a key insight on social networks to bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthemore, Sybil Guard assumes that social networks are fast mixing, which has never been confirmed in the real world. The p[38] presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of O(sqrt(n)), or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that SybilLimit1' guarantee is at most a log(n) factor away from optimal, when considering approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world social networks. The p[38] provide the first evidence that real-world social networks are indeed fast mixing. This validates the fundamental assumption behind SybillLimit's and SybilGuard s approach;P38
SPTK24;Sybyl Guard;Peer-to-peer and other decentralized, distributed systems are known to be particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks. In a sybil attack, a malicious user obtains multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct nodes in the System. By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system, the malicious user is able to out vote the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks. Our protocol is based on the socil network among user identities, Where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately-small cut in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number ot identities a malicious user can create. we show the effectiveness of SybilGuard both analytically and experimentally;P39
SPTK25;Lightweight Defense Scheme;The p[90] proposed a Lightweaght Defense Scheme against Selective Forwarding Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks that can be used in IoT application. According to characteristics of easy positioning the nodes around transmission paths in a structured topology made of hexagonal mesh, the nodes around transmission path are used to monitor packet transmission of its neighbor nodes, judge the attackers location and resend the packets dropped by the attackers. The method is etfective in detecting selective forwarding attacks to ensure reliable packet delivery. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme consumes less energy and storage. More details in p[90]. Advantages: The routing discover scheme is dynamically generating path which makes adversary difficult to launch attack. There is no traftic overhead to detect malicious node. Neighbour nodes are judging the malicious nature of a node, so no need of shared key between every two nodes in the network, which reduces storage required. Eficient utilization of energy since only one node is active at a time in each RC. Drawbacks: How much trustworthy a monitor node is? -If a node is malicious, the scheme did not explain whether to remove complete RC or only that node from routing discovery process. If we are removing complete RC then not efficient resource utilization. -Routing is a probability based one which is not an optimal one. We require GPS to acquire the locations of nodes which makes network costly.;p45,p90
SPTK26;Multi Data Flow Scheme;Multi Data Flow Scheme is a single scheme which defends against selective forwarding attack. The scheme uses multiflow topologies to defend the attack. In multi-dataflow scheme, the whole network is divided into different data topologies that makes, a sensor node belonging to one topology can communicate and send information only through nodes of the same topology. This division can be done at diferent times. Generaly division takes place at deployment time. If not then the nodes can randomly choose a topology number after deployment phase. The condition in this scheme is that every topology has to cover the sensing area completely. More details in [p91]. Advantages Of this Scheme: In this scheme no need of any additional hard-ware/software is needed to mitigate the attack. There won't be any packet loss or delay due to attack due to which packet delivery ratio will be high. Drawbacks: Network cost is high. Network lifetime will be low since due to multi data transmission. If attack occurs in all topologies then there wont be any defense from attack;P45,P91
SPTK27;Flooding Attack Prevention;To defend routing protocols against the Ad hoc Flooding attack, we develop a generic secure component, called Flooding Attack Prevention (AP) which can be applied to AODV routing protocol to allow that protocol to resist the rushing attack. Flooding Attack Prevention (FAC), a generic defense against the Ad hoc Flooding Attack. When the intruder broadcasts exceeding packets or Route Request, the immediate neighbors or the intruder record the rate of Route Request. Once the threshold is exceeded, nodes deny any future request packets from the intruder. More details in p49;P49
SPTK28;Vulnerability Scan;Mitigation solutions include constant vulnerability scans using malware pattem classification [p50] and risk mitigation services. The pattem classification can be done using the autonomic control loop component of "Analysis" following which the autonomic "execution" of the mitigation service can be performed;p50
SPTK29;Clustering Protocols;Clustering protocols can be used agonist to railures and attacks. The Pertectly anonymous data aggregation protocol p[92] can be used in IoT Application. Clusterng and data aggregation in wireless sensor networks improves scalability, and helps the efficient use of scarce resources. Yet, these mechanisms also introduce some security issues. In particular, aggregator nodes become attractive targets of physical destruction and jamming attacks. In order to mitigate this problem, [p92] propose a new private aggregator node election protocol that hides the identity of the elected aggregator nodes both from external eavesdroppers and from compromised nodes participating in the protocol. p[92] also propose a private data aggregation protocol and a corresponding private query protocol which allows the aggregators to collect sensor readings and respond to queries of the base station, respectively, without revealing any useful information about their identity to external eavesdroppers and to compromised nodes. Others Clustering protocols are discussed in p[5l] and can be applied in IoT applications;P51,P92
SPTK30;Risk Assessment;It is fundamental tor the continuing security of the system, by discovering new threats, applying Updates and patches to the firmware on the system devices, as well as providing improvements in the existing security structure. Risk Assessment: b) Finding New Threats, c) Applying Updates d) Applying Patches, e) Providing Improvements and Upgrading Systems.;P60
SPTK31;Securing the Premises;Securing the premises is perhaps the most important security feature that IoT needs, as it physically secures the IoT devices, i.e. sensor nodes, computers, firewalls, data servers, etc. The security of the loT devices is achieved by using Physical Barriers to block any unauthorized people, Intrusion Detection systems to monitor any strange benavior, Access Control to make sure only legible users enters the premises of the IoT and even Security personnel to ensure total security of the IoT devices. Securing the IoT Premises: a) Physical Barriers b) Intrusion Detection Alarms c)Monitoring Devices d)Access Control Devices e)Securty Personnel;P60
SPTK32;IEEE Standards Solutions;The IEEE provides standard mechanisms for the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers which are useul in implementation ot a smart city. There exist three families that can provide low-power and short-range IoT operation for a smart city [7]. IEEE 802.15.4: Important characteristics include real-time quality by guarantying time slots, collision dodging through CSMA/CA and merged assistance for secure communication. Moreove, the devices include power management functions, for example energy detection and link quality. IEEE 802.15.1 is used in Bluetooth. IEEE 802.15.11 This technology is provided from WiFi Alliance, a trade association in control of the certifying products if they adjust to particular standards of interpretability. The WiFi Protected Access (WPA) [56] is a security protocol that has become the regulation for providing security .11 networks. Here by using an already shared encryption key (PSK) or digital certificates, the WPA algorithm Temporal Key Integnty Protocol (TKIP) encrypts information providing authentication to the particular networks. The WPA algorithm (TKIP) further improved upon to the new WPA2 [57] [56] that utilizes more securer encryption algorithm that is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Moreover this protocol also uses better and advanced kev distribution techniques., which help in improved session security to avoid eavesdropping;P111
SPTK33;Tag Blocking, Tag Sleeping and Selective Blocking;It is important to discuss various techniques and strategies that may play part in better security performance of RFID in a smart city. Privacy protection is an important need and right of the citizens and as discussed previously, that tag killing may play role in privacy protection but this also may lead to loss data permanently. A better option is tag sleeping When the tag does not need to to be read, it is put to sleep temporarily [45]. There is another concept of tag blocking and selective blocking [40].;P111
SPTK34;Re-encryption and Minimalist Cryptography;Privacy protection is an important need and right of the citizens and as discussed previously, that tag killing may play role in privacy protection but this also may lead to loss data pemanently. Other techniques include re-labeling approach, re-encryption and minimalist cryptography [45];P111
SPTK35;Data Coding and Multiple Re-Transmission;The interterence problems in the RFID system can be dealt by data coding, multiple re transmission and data integnty check.;P111
SPTK36;Hash Lock and Hash Link;Hash-Lock and Hash Link techniques are also important as they provide better authentication. There are other authentication techniques based on hash such as ID exchange and distributed RFID challenge/answer authentication [39];P111
DRTK1;Preventive Measures;It is an Availability and Resilience Perspective tactic of IoT-A. The choice Preventive measure (DC A.15) is aimed at preventing disastrous events, like data-loss, from occurring. To achieve this, data is replicated to have identical copies in reserve in case the original data gets lost. Consistency among the data replicas needs to be assured by the design. To minimize risks the replicas are better stored at different locations that the original data, preferably in the cloud.;P87
DRTK2;Detective Measures;It is a Availability and Resilience Perspective tactic of IoT-A. "Detective measures (DC A.16) aim at detecting or discovering unwanted events by monitoring indicators for unwanted events, like measured values that exceed a certain range. This strategy requires an Information Model of those unwanted events together with their indicators that are used to detect the unwanted event. The event detection should be operated independent of the subsystem that is monitored to make sure the unwanted events can be detected.;P87
DRTK3;Corrective Measures;It is an Availability and Resilience Perspective tactic of IoT-A. The design choice "Corrective measures (DC A.17) is aimed at corecting or restoring systems after disastrous events have occured. Assuming the previous two choices have been implemented, meaning the preventive methods have been applied and the disastrous event has been detected corectly, the system can be restored to working order again. Backups of system configurations that have worked corectly before are restored. A configuration history provides the functionality needed for restoring working configurations. The system corection process needs to be operated independently of the system to be restored.;IoT-A
DRTK4;Business Continuity Plan (BCP);Applyinga Business Continuity Plan meta-model is a way to ensure the ability to operate in spite of unforeseen events and to quickly recover from any type of business interuption. A BCP meta-model formalizes essential aspects and concepts of Business Continuity Management in a socio-technical system. The BCP meta-model is generic enough to be applied to any healthcare organization and Iot Application.;P84
DRTK5;Backup Strategies;A good backup strategy is the best defense against data loss. A backup strategy or backup policy is essentially a set of procedures that you prepare and implement to protect your important digital content from hard drive failures, virus attacks and other events or disasters. Features of a Good Backup Strategy are: a) Able to recover from data loss in all circumstances like hard drive failure, virus attacks, theft, accidental deletes or data entry erors, sabotage, fire, flood, earth quakes and other natural disasters. b) Able to recover to an earlier state if necessary like due to data entry errors or accidental deletes. c) Able to recover as quickly as possible with minimum effort, cost and data loss. d) Require minimum ongoing human interaction and maintenance after the initial setup. Hence able to run automated or semi-automated. Planning Your Backup Strategy: 1) What to Backup. 2) Where to Backup to, 3) When to Backup, 4) Backup Types, 5) Compression and Encryption, 6) Testing your backup and 7) Backup utilities and services.;P85,P86
SCTK1;Dynamic Configuration;Dynamic system reconfigurability can be achieved with replacing the application software or alter its configuration on-the-fly. One method to replace an application from live mote is to utilize dynamic linking and loading to change required application modules. Traditionally most of the configuration of the application is hardcoded to the application binary image, which must be replaced if a configuration change is desired. Replacement of the binary image is costly operation in terms of resource use. If application logic is separated from the configuration it is easier to replace only needed parts of the configuration to change behavior of the application, if the desired change in behavior is small enough so the old application logic can handle the new behavior too. Replacing configuration is also cheaper operation in tems of resource use than replacement of whole binary image. Support for dynamic changes on the system configuration is required so the system can be adjusted for new conditions. Reconfigurable system is also the starting point for development of self-managing system that can adjust its operation automatically in response to changes in its environment.;P1
SCTK2;LEACH;The use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is anticipated to bring enomous changes in data gathering, processing and dissemination for different environments and applications. However, a WSN is a power constrained system, since nodes nun on limited power batteries which shorten its lifespan. Prolonging the network lifetime depends on efticient management of sensing node energy resource. Hierarchical routing protocols are best known in regad to energy efficiency. By using a clustering technique hierarchical routing protocols greatly minimize energy consumed in collecting and disseminating data. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the fundamental protocols in this class. The [p78] proposed Advanced LEACH (A-LEACH), a heterogeneous-energy protocol to decrease probability of failure nodes and to prolong the time interval before the death of the first node (we refer to as stability period) and increasing the lifetime in heterogeneous WSNs, which is crucial for many applications such as ToT applications.;P78
SCTK3;Dynamic Modulation Scaling;Dynamic modulation scaling (DMS) is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at node-level reconfiguration used to reconfigure modulation schemes in communication to achieve energy efficiency in WSN. DMS has been utilized to reduce energy consum ption in wireless communication, where the communication energy was reduced by changing the modulation level of the communication at the cost of increased transmission time. Significant research and development efforts have been made on the scheduling algorithm for DMS to provide significant energy savings while maintaining the time constraints. The [p79] explain some DMS techniques that can be used in loT application.;P79
SCTK4;Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS);Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) Is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at node-level reconfiguration used to reconfigure voltages and operating frequency of processors to achieve energy efficiency in WSN. The utilization of DVS technique required consideration of time constraints because the changes in operating frequency interfered with the computation time given a fixed computation workload. Hence, a scheduling algorithm was usually accompanied with DVS technique to guarantee the time constraint, especially in real-time applications. Researchers have worked on scheduling algorithms for using DVS in different applications. The p[79] explain some DVS techniques that can be used in loT a pplication.;P79
SCTK5;Adaptative Sampling Rate;Adaptive Sampling Rate Is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at node-level reconfiguration used to change the sampling rate of sensors to achieve energy efficiency in WSN.;P80
SCTK6;Intelligent Node Activation; Intelligent Node Activation is a dynamic reconfiguration technique at network-level reconfiguration used to change sensor node status to achieve energy efficiency in WSN. Intelligent node activation determines node activity to minimize redundant energy usage within the network. It involved redundant deployment of sensor nodes to allow a sensor node to go into sleep mode without degrading network performance. This reduced the overall energy consumption of the network by taking redundant nodes off line and scheduling active/sleep states of the sensor nodes.;P79,P81
SHTK1;SHA Based on MAPE-k loop;Fault tolerance is essential in the IoT. The number of vulnerable systems and attacks will increase, so there is a need to develop intrusion detection and prevention systems to protect the components of the IoT. The growth of connected devices in IoT makes the human intervention less effective. Autonomic computing aims to reduce the human intervention in complex systems, like the human nervous system controls autonomically some functions of body, like the digestive system. The proposed architecture defines five components, distributed between the monitoring phase, analysis phase and knowledge component, to add the property of self-healing into the Internet of Things. The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) is combined with an Artificial Intelligence component to allow the DCA learning the role of each Infomation sensed. The architecture described in this paper can implement a self-healing system in IoT nodes distributing roles between them in order to ease design of self-healing systems for IoT. Below we can see SELF-HEALING ARCHITECTURE based on MAPE-K loop that can be used in IoT application. More details in [p9];P9
SHTK2;SHÃµWA;The complexity of systems is considered an obstacle to the progress of the IT industry. Autonomic computing is presented as the altemative to cope with the growing complexity. It is a holistic approach, in which the systems are able to configure, heal, optimize, and protect by themselves. Web-based applications are an example of systems where the complexity is high. The number of components, their interoperability, and workload variations are factors that may lead to perfomance failures or unavailability scenarios. The occurrence of these scenarios affects the revenue and reputation of businesses that rely on these types of applications. The [p12] presented a self-healing framework for Web-based applications (SH6WA). SH3WA is composed by several modules, which monitor the application, analyze the data to detect and pinpoint anomalies, and execute recovery actions autonomously. The monitoring is done by a small aspect-oriented programming agent. This agent does not require changes to the application source code and includes adaptive and selective algorithms to regulate the level of monitoring. The anomalies are detected and pinpointed by means of statistical corelation. The data analysis detects changes in the server response time and analyzes if those changes are corelated with the workload or are due to a perfomance anomaly. In the presence of perfomance anomalies, the data analysis pinpoints the anomaly. Upon the pinpointing of anomalies, SH3WA executes a recovery procedure. Below we can see the Building blocks of the SHÃ´WA framework that can be used in IoT application. More details in [p12].;P12
SHTK3;ACOSHR;Recent advances in Compact and wireless embedded Systems coupled wvith the technological innovations in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems(MEMS), Wireless Communications and networks paved the way for the development of small, resource constrained devices called Sensor Nodes (SNs). Perfomance of Sensor Node is highly dependent on the effective and efficient usage of the available limited resources with it, leading to maximum lifetime of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) which is a primary concem of wSNs. The depletion of a SN energy leads to change in topology of WSNs often over a period of time. Therefore, protocols which consider the dynamic nature of WSNs are crucial for improving the netwok lifetime. The [p13] proposed bio inspired Ant Colony optimization based Self healing routing scheme inspired by swam Intelligence technique to improve lifetime of a WSN. ACOSHR finds path by launching a colony of artificial ants that move through wireless links between source and destination. ACOSHR detemines path by considering both the remaining energy in the nodes and shorter lengths using the hop distance. Thus, ACOSHR maximizes the lifetime of the WSN. Below we can see the Flow chart for ACOSHR that can be used in IoT application More details in [p13];P13
SHTK4;Classical Counter Measures for Self Healing;Security solutions have been classified as either self-protecting or self-healing, in relation to the autonomic mechanism used for mitigation. Self-protecting solutions follow a passive approach and attempt to prevent security threats before they happen. This is done using various cryptographic techniques, with the knowledge of how common attacks are executed. In the case of self-healing solutions, the specific counter- measures for mitigation are taken only after the attack has been detected. Reactive measures are easier to achieve than protective measures, as typically the attacks aim confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity or privacy. Nevertheless, it is important to incude protective mechanisms as well supplementing the reactive mechanisms, resulting in what we call as hvbrid schemes. In [p15] is presented countemeasures.;P15
SHTK5;DEEJAM;Jamming is a very effective denial-of-service attack that renders most higher-layer secunty mechanisms mootyet it is often ignored in WSN design. The [p19] showed that an intemupt jamming attack is simple to perpetrate in software using a MICAzmote, is energy efficient and stealthy for the jammer, and completely disrupts communication. Thus, [p19] presented DEEJAM, a novel MAC-layer protocol for defeating stealthy jammers with IEEE 802.15.4-based hardware, to address this problematic area. It layers four defensivemechanisms to hide communication from a jammer, evade its search, and reduce its impact. DEEJAM defeated the other-wise devastating intemupt jammer, and achieves a packet delivery ratio of 88% in the presence ofa pulse jammer. More details in [p19];P19
SHTK6;Puzzle Schemes;Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are on the ise in recent years and many cryptographic cient puzzle schemes have been proposed for mitigating such attacks. Nonetheless, these schemes lack a strategy for setting the puzzle difficulty parameter which is an important issue for the legitimate users as they should not be unfairly delayed during low server loads. The [p32]. proposed a leaky bucket rate limiting queue mechanism to set the puzzle difficulty according to a queue delay. This mechanism will rate limit the number of incoming requests to prevent server overloading. As a result, DoS attackers have to spend more time to solve harder puzzles which reduces their rate of attack success. More details in [p32];P32
FRTK1;MultipathRouting;Active replication in WSN is applied in scenarios where many nodes provide the identical functionality. One example is.a service that periodically provides sensor data. Nodes that run such service activate their sensors and send their analysis to an aggregation service or to a base station. When some of the nodes fail to offer infomation, the receiver still gets the results from other nodes, which is often sufficient. Fault recovery in the presence of active replicas is relatively simple. Multipath routing is Active replication approach. Multipath routing can be used to actively replicate routing paths. In [p93] was proposed an algorithm that calculates the minimum amount of additional nodes and their positions to guarantee k-connectivity between nodes that can be used in IoT application.;P61,P93
FRTK2;Sensor Value Aggregation;Active replication in WSN is applied in scenarios where many nodes provide the identical functionality. One example is a service that periodically provides sensor data. Nodes that run such service activate their sensors and send their analysis to an aggregation service or to a base station. When some of the nodes fail to offer infomation, the receiver still gets the results from other nodes, which is often sufficient. Fault recovery in the presence of active replicas is relatively simple. Sensor value aggregation is Active replication approach. Sensor value fusion is a research area that seeks to provide high level infomation derived from a number of low-level sensor inputs. There, the inherent redundancy of sensor nodes can be used to provide fault-tolerant data aggregation. This is achieved through a tradeoff between the precision (the length) of the resulting sensor reading interval and the number of faulty sensors. This ensures that despite of node failures, the resulting reading interval will contain the comect sensor reading of aregion;P61
FRTK3;Ignore Values from Faulty Nodes;Active replication in \wSNis applied in scenarios where many nodes provide the identical functionality. One example is aservice that periodically provides sensor data. Nodes that run such service activate their sensors and send their analysis to an aggregation service or to a base station. When some of the nodes fail to offer information, the receiver still gets the results from other nodes, which is often sufficient. Fault recovery in the presence of active replicas is relatively simple. Ignore values from faulty nodes is Active replication approach. A simple but efficient solution to not propagate a failure of one specific node to the entire network is to ignore the data that it is generating. This can be applied like [p94]. The major chalenge in this case is the identification of the malfunctioning nodes.;P61,P94
FRTK4;Self Election;When pasSive replication is applied, the primary replica receives all requests and processes them. In order to maintain reliability between replicas, the state of the primary replica and the request infommation are transfemed to the backup replicas. Given the constraints of WSNs, applications should be designed to have only little or no state at all, which minimizes the overhead for transfering state infomation between nodes or eliminates it all together. Node selection: After it has been established that certain functionality is not available any longer due to failure in the primary replica, a new service provider must be selected. Afte. this selection phase, one or several nodes become service providers. Several approaches to how the selection is perfomed have been proposed and Self election is a approach. Self election: In LEACH [p78], nodes periodically execute a probabilistic algorithm to establish whether they should serve as cluster head to their neighbors. In this probabilistic rotation system, nodes keep changing their role in the network. When a cluster head node fails, it will take only one rotation period until another node starts providing the functionality of the failed or absent node.;P61
FRTK5;Group Election;When passive replication is applied, the primary replica receives all requests and processes them. In order to maintain reliability between replicas, the state of the primary replica and the request infomation are transfered to the backup replicas. Given the constraints of WSNs, applications should be designed to have only little or no state at all, which minimizes the overhead for transfering state information between nodes or eliminates it all together. Node selection: After it has been established that certain functionality is not available any longer due to failure in the primary replica, one or several nodes become service providers. Several approaches to how the selection is perfomed have been proposed and Group election is a approach. In [p95]. a reallocation of nodes that were part of a cluster that suffered a cluster head failure is Proposed. The cluster head, called gateway, is considered to be a resourceful node. The solution presented considers that all the gateways in the network maintain a list of the nodes that are curently in their cluster and another backup list of nodes that could become part of their cluster. When a gateway fails, the nodes from its cluster are reallocated to the other gateways that have the nodes in their backup lists. If more than one gateway has a specific node in its backup list the node is assigned to the cluster head that has the smallest communication cost. new service provider must be selected. After this selection phase,.;P61
FRTK6;Hierarchical Election;When pa5SIve replication is applied, the primary replica receives all requests and processes them. In order to maintain reliability between replicas, the state of the primary replica and the request infommation are transfered to the backup replicas. Given the constraints of WSNs, applications should be designed to have only little or no state at all, which minimizes the overhead for transfering state infomation between nodes or eliminates it all together. Node selection: After it has been established that certain functionality is not available any longer due to failure in the primary replica, a new service provider must be selected. After. this selection phase, one or several nodes become service providers. Several approaches to how the selection is performed have been proposed and Hierarchical election is a approach. Hierarchical election: In a hierarchical election, a coordinator selects the new primary node. This applies to the rebuilding ofrouting paths as well as the selection ofa new cluster head. The fomer describes an algorithm to select the node that is closest to the base station. The latter approach applies fuzzy logic in the base station to select which node will become a cluster head. This algorithm makes use of a fuzzy descriptor, the node concentration, energy level in each node and its centrality with respect to the entire cluster.;P61
FRTK7;Pre-Copy;When passive replication is applied, theprimary replica receives all requests and processes them. In order to maintain reliability between replicas, the state of the primary replica and the request information are transfered to the backup replicas. Given the constraints of WSNs, applications should be designed to have only little or no state at all, which minimizes the overhead for transfeming state information between nodes or eliminates it all together. Service Distribution: During this phase, nodes elected to become service providers must activate the service. In some cases the service is already available on the nodes and a simple configuration change to infom the node that this service should be activated is required. However in some cases, for instance when nodes do not have enough memory to store the code of all potential services, it is necessary to inject code into the node through some technique. There are different techniques that can be used for service distribution: completely reprogramming the node, sending entire blocks of executable code, or sending small pieces of code such as scripts. Pre-Copy: Pre-copying as described in [p96], consists in making the code of all services available on all nodes before deployment. This allows nodes to change their behavior according to the role that they are assigned to.;P61,P96
FRTK8;Code Distribution;When passive replication is applied, the primary replica receives all requests and processes them. In order to maintan reliability between Ieplicas, the state ot the primary replica and the request nfomation are transfered to the backup replicas. Given the constraints of WSNs, applications should be designed to have only little or no state at all, which minimizes the overhead for transfeming state infomation between nodes or eliminates it all together. Service Distribution: During this phase, nodes elected to become service providers must activate the service. In some cases the service is already available on the nodes and a simple configuration change to infom the node that this service should be activated is required. However in some cases, for instance when nodes do not have enough memory to store the code of all potential services, it is necessary to inject code into the node through some technique. Thereare different techniques that can be used for service distribution: completely reprogramming the node, sending entire blocks of executable code, or sending small pieces of code such as scripts Code distribution: Several approaches have been proposed for disseminating code throughout the network. The [p97] is an example for a byte code interpreter for Tiny OS where code is broken into capsules of 24 instructions, called MATE. These capsules can be distributed through the network and installed on nodes, which start to execute thenew code.;P61,P97
FRTK9;Remote Execution;When passive replication is applied, the primary replica receives all requests and processes them. In order to maintain reliability between replicas, the state of the primary replica and the request infommation are transfered to the backup replicas. Given the constraints of WSNs, applications should be designed to have only little or no state at all, which minimizes the overhead for transfering state infomation between nodes or eliminates it all together. Service Distribution: During this phase, nodes elected to become service providers must activate the service. In some cases the service is already available on the nodes and a simple configuration change to infom the node that this service should be activated is required.

There are different techniques that can be used for service distribution: completely reprogramming the node, sending entire blocks of executable code, or sending small pieces of code such as scripts. Remote Execution: On the one hand code migrations an approach that reduces the amount of memory required in the entire network since not all nodes need to have the application pre-installed, on the other hand it consumes energy on the nodes exchanging the code and is susceptible to link failures, which could cause long delays until the code update is completed. Remote Execution [p98] is an altemative approach where low power devices transfer tasks to more powerful devices without transfenming the entire application code. Instead, only the required state information is transmitted. Such an approach is especially suited for heterogeneous sensor networks with at least some resourceful nodes.;P61,P98
SOTK1;MATÃ Virtual Machine to WSN;Composed of tens of thousands of tiny devices with very limited resources (motes), sensor networks are subject to novel systems problems and constraints. The large number of motes in a sensor network means that there will often be some failing nodes, networks must be easy to repopulate. Often there is no feasible method to recharge motes, so energy is a precious resource. Once deployed, a network must be reprogrammable although physically unreachable, and this reprogramming can be a sign cant energy cost. The [p97] present MatÃ©, a tiny communication-centric virtual machine designed for sensor networks. MatÃ© is high-level interface allows complex programs to be very short (under 100 bytes), reducing the energy cost of transmitting new programs. Code is broken up into small capsules of 24 instructions, which can self- replicate through the network. Packet sending and reception capsules enable the deployment of ad-hoc routn and data a regation algorithms. MatÃ© is concise, high-level program representation simplies programming and allovws large networks to be frequently re-programmed in an energy-eefficient manner, in addition, its safe execution environment suggests a use of virtual machines to provide the user/kemel boundary on motes that have no hardware protection mechanisms. MatÃ© is a virtual machines designed to run on WSN motes. Virtual machines in WSN enable more flexible development and deployment of WSNs by allowing easy updates of software of the motes. The virtual machine.executing the code application softwarehave complete knowledge of the state ofthe application Also the virtual machines can modify the code of the application on execution. So if the virtual machine is smart enough it can adjust behavior of the applications when needed. With virtual machines it is also possible to do dynamically reconfigure the running application. Use of virtual machines are usually more costly on resources than use of native code, due the overheads in computation caused by the virtual machine.;P1,P97
SOTK2;SwissQM Virtual Machine to WSN;Sensor networks are increasingly being deployed for a wide variety of tasks. Today, in these networks, the development, deployment, and maintenance of applications are perfomed largely ad-hoc. Existing platforms help somewhat but also introduce implicit trade-offs. In one extreme, low level programming platfoms and languages make programming cumbersome and eror-prone. In the other extreme, declarative approaches greatly facilitate programming but restrict what can be done. In both cases, additional limitations include lack of support for concurency, difficulties in changing applications, and insufficient abstractions from low-level details. The [p99] presented SwissQM, a virtual machine designed to address all these limitations. SwissQM offers a platform-independent programming abstraction that is geared towards data acquisition and in-network data processing. SwissQMis a virtual machines designed to run on WSN motes. Virtual machines in WSN enable more flexible development and deployment of WSNs by allowing easy updates of software of the motes. The virtual machins.executing the code application softwarehave complete knowledge of the state of the application. Also the virtual machines can modify the code of the application on execution. So if the virtual machine is smart enough it can adjust behavior of the applications when needed. With virtual machines it is also possible to do dymamically reconfigure the running application. Use of virtual machines are usually more costly on resources than use of native code, due the overheads in computation caused by the virtual machinE;P1,P99
DTK1;Self-Diagnosis;The goal of fault detection is to verify that the services being provided are functioning properly, and in some cases to predict if they will continue to function properly in the near future. The simplest method is to perfom visual observation and manual removal of incorect values. This technique offers drawbacks, human interaction leads to errors, it has a high cost and it is not efficient. Hence automatic fault detection techniques for WSN used. Through self diagnosis the node itself can identify faults in its components. Self-Diagnosis: In many cases, nodes can identify possible failures by performing self diagnosis. In [pl00]. the authors propose an approach where a node would perfom a self-diagnosis based on the measurements of accelerometers to detemine if the node suffers from an impact that could lead to hardware malfunctions. Using a similar approach, nodes could detect when they are being moved to a different location. Another approach would be to keep track of the identities of the nodes in the neighborhood. A considerable change in the neighborhood could indicate that either the node itself or some of its previous neighbors have been moved. Faults caused by battery exhaustion can be predicted when the hardware allows the measurement of the current battery voltage [p101]. By analyzing the battery discharge curve and the curent discharge rate, an algornthm can determine an estimation of the time to death of the battery. Nodes can also identify that their curent connection to surrounding nodes is unreliable by probing the link connection therefore identifying that it is isolated.;P61,P100
DTK2;Group Detection;The goal of fault detection is to verify that the services being provided are functioning properly, and in some cases to predict if they will continue to function properly in thee near future. The simplest method is to perfom visual observation and manual removal of incorect values. This technique offers drawbacks, human interaction leads to erors, it has a high cost andit is not efficient. Hence automatic fault detection techniques for WSN used. With group detection, several nodes monitor the behavior of another node. Group Detection: The detection of services failing due to incorectly generated values is only possible ifa reference value is available. In [p102] a detection mechanism is proposed to identify faulty sensor nodes. Algorithm is based on the idea that sensors from the same region should have similar values unless a node is at the boundary of the event-region. The algorithm start by taking measurements of all neighbors of a node and uses the results to calculate the probability of the node being faulty. In [p103]. amisbehavior detection algorithm to aid the routing layer is proposed. The misbehavior detection mechanism is based on the idea of monitoring the communication of the service provider to verify whether messages are forwarded corectly. Focusing on providing a fault-tolerant approach for clusters in WSNs, in [p95] it is proposed to support the dymamic recovery of failed gateways. The proposed protocol assumes that a gateway has failed only when no other gateways can communicate withit. The fault detection mechanism is based on constant status updates being exchanged between gateways and further use of a consensus algorithm.;P61,P102,P103,P95
DTK3;Hierarchical Detection;The goal of fault detection is to verify that the services being provided are fÃ¼unctioning properly, and in some cases to predict if they will continue to function properly in the near future. The simplest method is to perfom visual observation and manual removal of incorect values. This technique offers drawbacks, human interaction leads to erors, it has a high cost and it is not efficient. Hence automatic fault.detection techniques for WSN used. Hierarchical detection the fault detection is perfomed using a detection tree where a hierarchy is defined for the identification of failed nodes. Often in a hierarchical detection the detection is shifted to a more powerful device such as the sink Hierarchical Detection: In [104] was proposed the usage of the network topology to forward the fault detection results of child nodes to their parent nodes and finally to sink nodes. Every node forwards the condition of the child nodes that it is monitoring to their parent node. The parent node camies out an aggregation operation on the outcomes of the child nodes together with its own results and forwards it to the further process. The proposed approach scales well with the network size, but it consumes resources of the network. Shifting the fault detection job to a more powerful device is an altemative that can help to increase the lifetime of the WSN. In [p105]. was proposed an algorithm that puts the burden of detecting and tracing failed nodes to the base station. At first the nodes find out the network topology and send their part of the topology nfomation to the sink node. With this information the base station leams the complete network topology which is used to send route updates quickly as it detects that nodes become silent. This approach is not applicable to event-driven WSN because in such a network sensors only send messages when there is an event that should be reported, for instance when the temperature goes above In [p106]. was proposeda mechanism that uses a hierarchical network topology where cluster heads monitor ordinary nodes, and the base station monitors the cluster heads. To perfom the monitoring. the base station and the cluster heads constantly ping those nodes that still have battery power left and that are under their direct supervision. Ifa node does not respond, it is marked as failed. In [p107] was proposed a debugging tool that also utilizes the hierarchical detection approach. This tool instruments the WSN with monitoring software on the sensor nodes that generates metrics data that is forwarded to a centralized sink location for analysis. With this infomation consideration is able to detect faults and failures and identify the fault that generated the failure.;P61,P104,P105,P106,P107
DTK4;Intrusion Detection System;An intrusion detection system is a sottware tool used to detect unauthonzed access to a computer system or network. An intrusion detection system is capable of detecting all types of malicious network traffic and computer usage. This incudes network attacks against vulnerable services, data driven attacks on applications, host-based attacks-such as privilege escalation, unauthorized logins and access to sensitive files-and malware. An intrusion detection system is a dynamic monitoring entity that complements the static monitoring abilities ofa firewall. An intrusion detection system monitors traffic in a network in promiscuous mode, very much like a network sniffer. The network packets that are collected are analyzed for rule violations by a pattem recognition algorithm. When rule violations are detected, the intrusion detection system alerts the administrator. The [p89] show same types of IDS that can be used in IoT application. Bellow we can see the organization of a generalized intusion detection svstem More details in [p89];P3,P4,P67,P89
DTK5;DoS detection architecture for 6LoWPAN;Smart objects connected to the Intemet, constituting the so called Intemet of Things (loT), are revolutionizing human beings interaction with the world. As technology reaches everywhere, anyone can misuse it, and it is always essential to secure it. In [p6] was presented a denial-of-service (DoS) detection architecture for 6LoWPAN, the standard protocol designed by IETF as an adaptation layer for low-power lossy networks enabling low-power devices to communicate with the Intemet. The proposed architecture integrates an intrusion detection system (IDS) into the network framework developed within the EU FP7 project ebbits. The aim is to detect DoS attacks based on 6LoWPAN. More details in [p6].;P6
DTK6;SVELTE;In the Internet of Things (loT), resource-constrained things are connected to the unreliable and untrusted Intermet via IPvÃ³ and 6LoWPAN networks. Even when they are secured with encryption and authentication, these things are exposed both to wireless attacks from inside the 6LoWPAN network and from the Intemet. Since these attacks may succeed, Intrusion Detection Systems (TIDS) are necessary. Currently, there are no IDSs that meet the requirements of the IPv6-connected IoT since the available approaches are either customized for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) or for the conventional Intemet. In [p10] was designed, implemented, and evaluated a novel intrusion detection system for the IoT that is called SVELTE. It can detect routing attacks such as spoofed or altered infomation, sinkhole, and selective-forwarding. However, the approach can be extended to detect other attacks. More details in [p10];P10
DTK7;Intrusion Detection of Sinkhole Attacks in WSN;In [p33], is presented an Intrusion Detection System designed for wireless sensor networks and show how it can be configured to detect Sinkhole attacks. A Sinkhole attack foms a serious threat to sensor networks.;P33
DTK8;Sinkhole Attack Detection Mechanism;In [p34]. is proposed a detection scheme for sinkhole attacks in wireless sensor networks. Sinkhole attack makes flowing packets to pass through attacker. As a consequence, Sinkhole attack can be extended to various kinds of attacks. the[p34] analyzed sinkhole attack methods in the networks that use LQI based routing. It showed that the detection of sinkhole attack can be achieved by using a few detector nodes.;p34
DTK9;Protocol to detect Sybil Attacks;Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are being increasingly advocated for traffic control, accident avoidance, and management of parking lots and public areas. Security and privacy are two major concems in VANETs. Unfortunately, in VANETs, most privacy-preserving schemes are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, whereby a malicious user can pret end to be multiple (other) vehicles. In [p37], was presented a lightweight and scalable protocol to detect Sybil attacks. In this protocol, a malicious user pretending to be multiple (other) vehicles can be detected in a distributed manner through passive overhearing by set of fixed nodes called road-side boxes (RSBs). The detection of Sybil attacks in this manner does not require any vehicde in the network to disclose its identity, hence privacy is preserved at all times. More details in [p37].;P37
DTK10;Sybil Attack Detection in MANETs;Fully self-organized mobile ad hoc networks (MANETS) represent complex distributed systems that may also be part of a huge complex system, such as a complex system-of-systems used for crisis management operations. Due to the complex nature of MANETs and its resource constraint nodes, there has always been a need to develop lightweight security solutions. Since MANETs require a unique, distinct, and persistent identity per node in order for their security protocols to be viable, Sybil attacks pose a serious threat to such networks. A Sybil attacker can either create more than one identity on a single physical device in order to launch a coordinated attack on the network or can switch identities in order to weaken the detection process, thereby promoting lack of accountability in the network. In the [p40] is proposed a lightweight scheme to detect the new identities of Sybil attackers without using centralized trusted third party or any extra hardware, such as directional antennae or a geographical positioning system.;P40
DTK11;Anomaly Detection Systems;As advances in networking technology help to connect the distant comers of the globe and as the Intermet continues to expand its infuence as a medium for communications and commerce, the threat from spammers, attackers and criminal enterprises has also grown accordingly. It is the prevalence of such threats that has made intrusion detection systems the cyberspace's equivalent to the burglar alam-join ranks with firewalls as one of the fundamental technologies fornetwork security. However, today's commercially available intusion detection systems are predominantly signature- based intusion detection systems that are designed to detect known attacks by utilizing the signatures of those attacks. Such systems require frequent rule-base updates and signature updates, and are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In contrast, anomaly detection systems, a subset of intrusion detection syst ems, model the nomal system/network behavior which enables them to be extremely effective in finding and foiling both known as well as unknown or "zero day" attacks. While anomaly detection systems are attractive conceptually, a host of technological problems need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. These problems include: high false alam rate, failure to scale to gigabit speeds, etc. The [p89] provides technological trends in anomaly detection that can be used in IoT application.;P89
DTK12;CADE: Cumulative Acknowledgeme nt based Detection;Wireless sensor networks are networks consisting of nodes with sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions. Since nodes in wireless sensor networks have limited transmission capabilities, packets are generally transmitted to the destination node through several immediate nodes. However, ifa malicious node is present on a route through which packets are forward ed, attackers can deliver selective forwarding attacks by simply dropping packets. Selective forwarding attacks can be serious threats on many applications including networks for military surveillance and health-care monitoring. Previous countemeasures to selective forwarding attacks cannot identify Malicious nodes or require time synchronization. The [p43] presents a detecting scheme which identifies malicious nodes delivering selective forwarding attacks without the need for time synchronization. The scheme also provides security against sinkhole attacks where attackers try to attract more trafficto malicious nodes.;P43
DTK13;Defensive technique for selective forwarding attack in localization;In selective forwarding attack, malicious nodes may refuse to forward certain messages and simply drop them, ensuring that they are not propagated any more. Similarly, in sensor localization, a malicious node may refuse to forward the location information or drops them, with confimation that they are not propagated further. In [p44]. is proposed a defensive technique for selective forwarding attack in localization. It consists of 3 phases for secure infomation delivery. First phase is secret sharing of infomation, secondly randomized propagation of each information share, and finally minhop routing towards the anchor nodes. Each time an infomation packet needs to be sent, the packet is broke into t shares according to threshold secret sharing algorithm. When the anchor nodes collect at least t shares, original packet are reconstructed. Through simulation results, it is shown that this is effective defensive technique for selective forwarding attack.;P44
DTK14;Detection using acknowledgmen ts for selective forwarding attack;In the [p45] is showed a scheme which uses a multi-hop acknowledgment scheme to launch alams by obtaining responses from intemediate nodes. Each node in the forwarding path is incharge of detecting malicious nodes.;P45
DTK15;Detection Scheme in Hetrogeneous Networks for selective forwarding attack;In the [p45] is showed a scheme to detect selective forwarding using a Heterogeneous Sensor Net work(HSN) model. The HSN consists of powerfÃ¼l high-end sensors(H-sensors) and large number of low-end sensors(L-sensors). After deploying sensors, a cluster formation takes place with H-sensor as cluster head.;P45
DTK16;Detection Using Two hop Neighbourhood Infomation;Wireless sensor networks have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, WSNs are susceptible to many types of attacks because they are deployed in open and unprotected environment. Selective forwarding attack is one of the easiest implement and damaged attacks in multi- hop routing protocols. In [p108], was proposed a lightweight detection algorithm based only on the neighborhood information.

AAK1;Autonomic Architecture for IoT Gateway;With the advancement taking place in communication technologies., Intemet of Things (lol) is expected to play a major role in realizing smartness and functionality needed for applications such as Smart Homes and Electrical Smart Grids. However, in order to achieve that far reaching goal, select concepts of computing autonomy have to be suitably ported to Io T architecture. Recently reported works describe various frameworks, models and protocols for computing autonomy. Some others focus more on the practical Implementation of autonomy using self-star (self-) behavior in end nodes. The [p14] proposed an Autonomic architecture for IoT based on IBM's autonomic framework. In traditional wireless networks employed today for IoT, a Master Gateway Device (GWD), router or an access-point (AP), are commonly intertacing the wireless devices with the lntemet in a single-hop Configuration. The IoT Mobile Node Devices (MND) may either use IEEE 802.15.4 or IEEE 802.11 as their communication standard, but they still require a master gateway for establishing connection to other devices over the Internet. A single user is expected to own a multitude of these IoT devices, and deploy them for various sensing of data for monitoring purposes and sending instruction signals down the devices for Ã¾ctuating purposes. The Iol devices are supposed to be highly heterogeneous in nature and have varying requirements and functionalities which tend to increase the complexity of the network. In this case, a network will be fomed when at-least one MND manages to register successtully with a GWD. A large number of MNDs registering to the network creates problem of scalability, especially when it comes to reconfiguration issues according to the network requirements. The design of the solution is thus to fulfill the self-configuration of the network components. A modular, object oriented design is more scalable and can be easily deployed, changed and improved. IBM's autonomic framework is highly modular, and consequently configuration management tends to achieve high levels of modularity needed in the extension of services exercises. The [p14] design follows the same objectives and a highly abstracted architectural framework is presented. Bellow we can see the overall component architecture and their dependencies.

AAK2;Gateway System Architecture;In p82] was presented an intelligent architecture which consists ofa large number of sensing objects for monitoring purposes that can be used in IoT application. An embedded-based gateway for use in a monitoring system was proposed in an IoT network. The gateway is a critical component for collecting. recording and forwarding data obtained from sensors. Itjs programmable, low-cost, real-time and flexible. The software and hardware for wired and wireless communication interfaces are successful and suitable for field trials. More details in p82];P82
AAK3;Autonomic Computing IBM Framework;TBM p83J has introduced a framework of autonomic computing which is aimed to make the management of systems easier. The framework consists of two functionally important entities, namely, () Managed Resource and (2) Autonomic Manager. The managed resource is the less complex entity. In an lol setup, the managed resource is the end device, and comprises of sensors and effectors. Sensors are responsible to sense the environment and are merely data collectors. On the other hand, effectors are the interfaces that the device can use to manipulate the environment. The device thus provides access to the sensors and effectors through the 'manageability interface'. The autonomic manager is the highly complex entity and provides the central control and analysis. The functionality is broken down modularly in a control loop which is implemented by the autonomic manager component. As seen in the Figure bellow, the functioning of the control loop is divided into tour parts. The monitor part is responsible to colect details trom an element, to aggregate, filter, manage, and report all the data. The analyze part provides mechanisms modeling thus complex situations. This allows the autonomic manager to leam about the environment and predict fÃ¼ture situations. The plan module provides further mechanisms to guide the action with the help of policies, in order to achieve goals and objectives. Lastly, the.execute module controls execution of a pre-defined plans. More details in [p83].;P83
